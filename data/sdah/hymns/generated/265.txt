265 - Breathe On Me, Breath Of God


1
Breathe On Me, Breath Of God,
Fill Me With Life Anew,
That I May Love What Thou Dost Love,
And Do What Thou Wouldst Do.

2
Breathe On Me, Breath Of God,
Until My Heart Is Pure,
Until With Thee I Will One Will,
To Do And To Endure.

3
Breathe On Me, Breath Of God,
Till I Am Wholly Thine,
Until This Earthly Part Of Me
Glows With Thy Fire Divine.

4
Breathe On Me, Breath Of God,
So Shall I Constant Be,
And Live With Thee The Perfect Life
Of Thine Eternity.
