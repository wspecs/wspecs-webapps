264 - O For That Flame Of Living Fire


1
O For That Flame Of Living Fire
Which Shone So Bright In Saints Of Old;
Which Bade Their Souls To Heaven Aspire,
Calm In Distress, In Danger Bold!

2
Where Is That Spirit, Lord, Which Dwelt
In Abram'S Breast, And Sealed Him Thine?
Which Made Paul'S Heart With Sorrow Melt,
And Glow With Energy Divine?

3
That Spirit Which From Age To Age
Proclaimed Thy Love, And Taught Thy Ways?
Brightened Isaiah'S Vivid Page,
And Breathed In David'S Hallowed Lays?

4
Is Not Thy Grace As Mighty Now
As When Elijah Felt Its Power?
When Glory Beamed From Moses' Brow,
Or Job Endured The Trying Hour?

5
Remember, Lord, The Ancient Days;
Renew Thy Work, Thy Grace Restore;
And While To Thee Our Hearts We Raise,
On Us Thy Holy Spirit Pour.
