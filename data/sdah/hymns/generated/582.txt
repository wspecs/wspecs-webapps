582 - Working, O Christ, With Thee


1
Working, O Christ, With Thee, Working With Thee,
Unworthy, Sinful, Weak, Though We May Be;
Our All To Thee We Give, For Thee Alone We Live,
And By Thy Grace Achieve, Working With Thee.

2
Along The City'S Waste, Working With Thee,
Our Eager Footsteps Haste, Like Thee To Be;
The Poor We Gather In, The Outcasts Raise From Sin,
And Labor Souls To Win, Working With Thee.

3
Savior, We Weary Not, Working With Thee,
As Hard As Thine Our Lot Can Never Be;
Our Joy And Comfort This, "Thy Grace Sufficent Is;"
This Changes Toil To Bliss, Working With Thee.

4
So Let Us Labor On, Working With Thee,
Till Earth To Thee Is Won, From Sin Set Free;
Till Men, From Shore To Shore, Receive Thee, And Adore,
And Join Us Evermore, Working With Thee.
