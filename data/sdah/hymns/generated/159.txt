159 - The Old Rugged Cross


1
On A Hill Far Away Stood An Old Rugged Cross,
The Emblem Of Suffering And Shame;
And I Love That Old Cross Where The Dearest And Best
For A World Of Lost Sinners Was Slain.

Refrain
So I'Ll Cherish The Old Rugged Cross,
Till My Trophies At Last I Lay Down;
I Will Cling To The Old Rugged Cross,
And Exchange It Some Day For A Crown.

2
O That Old Rugged Cross, So Despised By The World,
Has A Wondrous Attraction For Me;
For The Dear Lamb Of God Left His Glory Above
To Bear It To Dark Calvary.

3
To That Old Rugged Cross I Will Ever Be True,
Its Shame And Reproach Gladly Bear;
Then He'Ll Call Me Some Day To My Home Far Away,
Where His Glory Forever I'Ll Share.
