622 - Come, Come, Ye Saints


1
Come, Come, Ye Saints, No Toil Nor Labor Fear;
But With Joy Wend Your Way.
Though Hard To You The Journey May Appear,
Grace Shall Be As Your Day.
We Will Have A Living Lord To Guide,
And We Can Trust Him To Provide;
Do This, And Joy Your Hearts Will Swell:
All Is Well! All Is Well!

2
We'Ll Find The Rest Which God For Us Prepared,
When At Last He Will Call;
Where None Will Come To Hurt Or Make Afraid,
He Will Reign Over All.
We Will Make The Air With Music Ring,
Shout Praise To God Our Lord And King:
O How We'Ll Make The Chorus Swell:
All Is Well! All Is Well!
