587 - In Christ There Is No East Nor West


1
In Christ There Is No East Nor West,
In Him No South Or North;
But One Great Fellowship Of Love
Throughout The Whole Wide Earth.

2
In Him Shall True Heart Everywhere
Their High Communion Find;
His Service Is The Golden Cord
Close Binding All Mankind.

3
Join Hands, Then, Brothers Of The Faith,
Whate'Er Your Race May Be.
Who Serves My Father As A Son
Is Surely Kin To Me.

4
In Christ Now Meet Both East And West,
In Him Meet South And North;
All Christly Souls Are One In Him
Throughout The Whole Wide Earth.
