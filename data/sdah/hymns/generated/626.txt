626 - In A Little While We'Re Going Home


1
Let Us Sing A Song That Will Cheer Us By The Way,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.
For The Night Will End In The Everlasting Day,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.

Refrain
In A Little While, In A Little While,
We Shall Cross The Billow'S Foam;
We Shall Meet At Last, When The Stormy Winds Are Past,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.

2
We Will Do The Work That Our Hands May Find To Do,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.
And The Grace Of God Will Our Daily Strength Renew,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.

3
We Will Smooth The Path For Some Weary, Wayworn Feet,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.
And May Loving Hearts Spread Around An Influence Sweet!
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.

4
There'S A Rest Beyond, There'S Relief From Every Care,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home;
And No Tears Shall Fall In That City Bright And Fair,
In A Little While We'Re Going Home.
