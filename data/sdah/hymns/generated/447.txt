447 - Long Upon The Mountains


1
Long Upon The Mountains Weary,
Have The Scattered Flocks Been Torn;
Dark The Dessert Paths, And Dreary;
Grievous Trials Have They Borne.
Now The Gathering Call Is Sounding,
Solemn In Its Warning Voice;
Union, Faith, And Love, Abounding,
Bid The Little Flock Rejoice.

2
Now The Light Of Truth They'Re Seeking,
In Its Onward Track Pursue;
All The Ten Commandments Keeping,
They Are Holy, Just, And True.
On The Words Of Lire They'Re Feeding,
Precious To Their Taste So Sweet;
All Their Master'S Percepts Heeding,
Bowing Humbly To His Feet.

3
In That Light Of Light And Beauty,
In That Golden City Fair,
Soon Its Pearly Gates They'Ll Enter,
And Of All Its Glories Share.
There, Divine The Soul'S Expansions;
Free From Sin, And Death, And Pain;
Tear Will Never Dim Those Mansions
Where The Souls Immortal Reign.

4
Soon He Comes! With Clouds Descending;
All His Saints, Entombed Arise;
The Redeemed, In Anthems Blending,
Shout Their Vict'Ry Thro' The Skies.
O, We Long For Thine Appearing;
Come, O Savior, Quickly Come!
Blessed Hope! Our Spirits Cheering,
Take Thy Ransomed Children Home.
