633 - When We All Get To Heaven


1
Sing The Wondrous Love Of Jesus;
Sing His Mercy And His Grace.
In The Mansions Bright And Blessed
He'Ll Prepare For Us A Place.

Refrain
When We All Get To Heaven,
What A Day Of Rejoicing That Will Be!
When We All See Jesus,
We'Ll Sing And Shout The Victory!

2
While We Walk The Pilgrim Pathway,
Clouds Will Overspread The Sky;
But When Traveling Days Are Over,
Not A Shadow, Not A Sigh.

3
Let Us Then Be True And Faithful,
Trusting, Serving Every Day;
Just One Glimpse Of Him In Glory
Will The Toils Of Life Repay.

4
Onward To The Prize Before Us!
Soon His Beauty We'Ll Behold;
Soon The Pearly Gates Will Open;
We Shall Tread The Streets Of Gold.
