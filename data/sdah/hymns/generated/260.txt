260 - Hover O'Er Me, Holy Spirit


1
Hover O'Er Me, Holy Spirit,
Bathe My Trembling Heart And Brow;
Fill Me With Thy Hallowed Presence,
Come, O Come And Fill Me Now.

Refrain
Fill Me Now, Fill Me Now,
Jesus, Come And Fill Me Now.
Fill Me With Thy Hallowed Presence,
Come, O Come And Fill Me Now.

2
Thou Canst Fill Me, Gracious Spirit,
Though I Cannot Tell Thee How;
But I Need Thee, Greatly Need Thee;
Come, O Come And Fill Me Now.

3
I Am Weakness, Full Of Weakness;
At Thy Sacred Feet I Bow;
Blest, Divine, Eternal Spirit,
Fill With Love, And Fill Me Now.

4
Cleanse And Comfort, Bless And Save Me;
Bathe, O, Bathe My Heart And Brow;
Thou Art Comforting And Saving,
Thou Art Sweetly Filling Now.
