473 - Nearer My God, To Thee


1
Nearer, My God, To Thee, Nearer To Thee!
E'En Though It Be A Cross That Raiseth Me,
Still All My Song Shall Be,
Nearer, My God, To Thee;
Nearer, My God, To Thee, Nearer To Thee!

2
Though Like The Wanderer, The Sun Gone Down,
Darkness Be Over Me, My Rest A Stone;
Yet In My Dreams I'D Be
Nearer, My God, To Thee;
Nearer, My God, To Thee, Nearer To Thee!

3
There Let The Way Appear, Steps Unto Heaven;
All That Thou Sendest Me, In Mercy Given;
Angels To Beckon Me
Nearer, My God, To Thee;
Nearer, My God, To Thee, Nearer To Thee!

4
Then, With My Waking Thoughts Bright With Thy Praise,
Out Of My Stony Griefs Bethel I'Ll Raise;
So By My Woes To Be
Nearer, My God, To Thee;
Nearer, My God, To Thee, Nearer To Thee!

5
Or If, On Joyful Wing Cleaving The Sky,
Sun, Moon, And Stars Forgot, Upward I Fly,
Still All My Song Shall Be,
Nearer, My God, To Thee;
Nearer, My God, To Thee, Nearer To Thee!
