525 - Hiding In Thee


1
O Safe To The Rock That Is Higher Than I,
My Soul In Its Conflicts And Sorrows Would Fly;
So Sinful, So Weary, Thine, Thine, Would I Be;
Thou Blest "Rock Of Ages," I'M Hiding In Thee.

Refrain
Hiding In Thee, Hiding In Thee,
Thou Blest "Rock Of Ages,"
I'M Hiding In Thee.

2
In The Calm Of The Noontide, In Sorrow'S Lone Hour,
In Times When Temptation Casts Over Me Its Power;
In The Tempests Of Life, On Its Wide, Heaving Sea,
Thou Blest "Rock Of Ages," I'M Hiding In Thee.

3
How Oft In The Conflict, When Pressed By The Foe,
I Have Fled To My Refuge And Breathed Out My Woe;
How Often, When Trials Like Sea Billows Roll,
Have I Hidden In Thee, O Thou Rock Of My Soul.
