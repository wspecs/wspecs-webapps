148 - O Love, How Deep, How Broad


1
O Love, How Deep, How Broad, How High,
Beyond All Thought And Fantasy,
That God, The Son Of God, Should Take
Our Mortal Form For Mortal'S Sake!

2
For Us Baptized, For Us He Bore
His Holy Fast And Hungered Sore;
For Us Temptation Sharp He Knew;
For Us The Tempter Overthrew.

3
For Us By Wickedness Betrayed,
For Us, In Crown Of Thorns Arrayed,
He Bore The Shameful Cross And Death;
For Us He Gave His Dying Breath.

4
For Us He Rose From Death Again,
For Us He Went On High To Reign;
For Us He Sent His Spirit Here
To Guide, To Strengthen, And To Cheer.

5
All Glory To Our Lord And God
For Love So Deep, So High, So Broad;
The Trinity Whom We Adore
Forevermore And Forevermore.
