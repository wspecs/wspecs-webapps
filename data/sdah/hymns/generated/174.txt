174 - Star Of Our Hope


1
Star Of Our Hope! He'Ll Soon Appear,
The Last Loud Trumpet Speaks Him Near;
Hail Him, All Saints, From Pole To Pole-
How Welcome To The Faithful Soul!

2
From Heaven Angelic Voices Sound:
Behold The Lord Of Glory Crowned,
Arrayed In Majesty Divine,
And In His Highest Glories Shine.

3
The Grave Yields Up Its Precious Trust,
Which Long Has Slumbered In The Dust,
Resplendent Forms Ascending, Fair,
Now Meet The Savior In The Air.

4
Descending With His Azure Throne,
He Claims The Kingdom For His Own;
The Saints Rejoice, They Shout, They Sing,
And Hail Him Their Triumphant King.
