076 - O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go


1
O Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go,
I Rest My Weary Soul In Thee;
I Give Thee Back The Life I Owe,
That In Thine Ocean Depths
Its Flow May Richer, Fuller Be.

2
O Light That Followest All My Way,
I Yield My Flickering Torch To Thee;
My Heart Restores Its Borrowed Ray,
That In They Sunshine'S Blaze
Its Day May Brighter, Fairer Be.

3
O Joy That Seekest Me Through Pain,
I Cannot Close My Heart To Thee;
I Trace The Rainbow Thru The Rain,
And Feel The Promise Is Not Vain,
That Morn Shall Tearless Be.

4
O Cross That Liftest Up My Head,
I Dare Not Ask To Fly From Thee;
I Lay In Dust Life'S Glory Dead,
And From The Ground There Blossoms
Red Life That Shall Endless Be.
