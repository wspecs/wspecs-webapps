283 - O Jesus, Thou Art Standing


1
O Jesus, Thou Art Standing,
Outside The Fast Closed Door,
In Lowly Patience Waiting
To Pass The Threshold O'Er:
O Shame, Professing Christians,
His Name And Sign Who Bear,
O Shame, Thrice Shame Upon Us,
To Keep Him Standing There!

2
O Jesus, Thou Art Knocking;
And Lo, That Hand Is Scarred,
And Thorns Thy Brow Encircle,
And Tears Thy Face Have Marred:
O Love That Passeth Knowledge,
So Patiently To Wait!
O Sin That Hath No Equal,
So Fast To Bar The Gate!

3
O Jesus, Thou Art Pleading
In Accents Meek And Low,
"I Died For You, My Children,
And Will You Treat Me So?"
O Lord, With Shame And Sorrow
We Open Now The Door;
Dear Savior, Enter, Enter,
And Leave Us Never More.
