393 - Lord Of The Sabbath


1
Lord Of The Sabbath And Its Light,
I Hail Thy Hallowed Day Of Rest;
It Is My Weary Soul'S Delight,
The Solace Of My Careworn Breast,
The Solace Of My Careworn Breast.

2
O Sacred Day Of Peace And Joy,
Thy Hours Are Ever Dear To Me;
Ne'Er May A Sinful Thought Destroy
The Holy Calm I Find In Thee,
The Holy Calm I Find In Thee.

3
How Sweetly Now They Glide Along!
How Hallowed Is The Calm They Yield!
Transporting Is Their Rapturous Song,
And Heavenly Visions Seem Revealed,
And Heavenly Visions Seem Revealed.

4
O Jesus, Let Me Ever Hail
Thy Presence With The Day Of Rest;
Then Will Thy Servant Never Fail
To Deem Thy Sabbath Doubly Blest,
To Deem Thy Sabbath Doubly Blest.
