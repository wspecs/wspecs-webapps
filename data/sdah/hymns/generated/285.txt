285 - Jesus Calls Us


1
Jesus Calls Us O'Er The Tumult
Of Our Life'S Wild, Restless Sea;
Day By Day His Sweet Voice Soundeth,
Saying, "Christian, Follow Me!"

2
Jesus Calls Us From The Worship
Of The Vain World'S Golden Store,
From Each Idol That Would Keep Us,
Saying, "Christian, Love Me More!"

3
In Our Joys And In Our Sorrows,
Days Of Toil And Hours Of Ease,
Still He Calls, In Cares And Pleasures,
"Christian, Love Me More Than These!"

4
Jesus Calls Us! By Thy Mercies,
Savior, May We Hear Thy Call,
Give Our Hearts To Thine Obedience,
Serve And Love Thee Best Of All.
