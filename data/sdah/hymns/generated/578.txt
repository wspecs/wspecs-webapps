578 - So Send I You


1
So Sent I You- By Grace Made Strong To Triumph
O'Er Hosts Of Hell, O'Er Darkness, Death, And Sin,
My Name To Bear, And In That Name To Conquer-
So Send I You, My Victory To Win.

2
So Send I You- To Take To Souls In Bondage
The Word Of Truth That Sets The Captive Fee,
To Break The Bonds Of Sin, To Loose Dearth'S Fetters-
So Send I You, To Bring The Lost To Me.

3
So Send I You- My Strength To Know In Weakness,
My Joy In Grief, My Perfect Peace In Pain,
To Prove My Power, My Grace, My Promised Presence-
So Send I You, Eternal Fruit To Gain.

4
So Send I You - To Bear My Cross With Patience,
And Then One Day With Joy To Lay It Down
To Hear My Voice, "Well Done, My Faithful Servant -
Come, Share My Throne, My Kingdom, And My Crown!"
As The Father Hath Sent Me, So Send I You."
