284 - For You I Am Praying


1
I Have A Savior, He'S Pleading In Glory,
A Dear, Loving Savior, Though Earth Friends Be Few;
And Now He Is Watching In Tenderness O'Er Me,
But Oh That My Savior Were Your Savior, Too.

Refrain
For You I Am Praying, For You I Am Praying,
For You Am I Praying, I'M Praying For You.

2
I Have A Father; To Me He Has Given
A Hope For Eternity, Blessed And True;
And Soon He Will Call To Meet Him In Heaven,
But Oh That He'D Let Me Bring You With Me, Too!

3
I Have A Robe; 'Tis Resplendent In Whiteness,
Awaiting In Glory My Wondering View;
Oh, When I Receive It, All Shining In Brightness,
Dear Friend, Could I See You Receiving One, Too!

4
When Jesus Has Found You, Tell Others The Story,
That My Loving Savior Is Your Savior, Too;
Then Pray That Your Savior Will Bring Them To Glory,
And Prayer Will Be Answered-'Twas Answered For You!
