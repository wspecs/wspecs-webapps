537 - He Leadeth Me


1
He Leadeth Me: O Blessed Thought!
O Words With Heavenly Comfort Fraught!
Whate'Er I Do, Where'Er I Be,
Still 'Tis God'S Hand That Leadeth Me.

Refrain
He Leadeth Me, He Leadeth Me,
By His Own Hand He Leadeth Me;
His Faithful Follower I Would Be,
For By His Hand He Leadeth Me.

2
Sometimes Mid Scenes Of Deepest Gloom,
Sometimes Where Eden'S Bowers Bloom,
By Waters Still, O'Er Troubled Sea,
Still 'Tis His Hand That Leadeth Me.

3
Lord, I Would Place My Hand In Thine,
Nor Ever Murmur Nor Repine;
Content, Whatever Lot I See,
Since 'Tis My God That Leadeth Me.

4
And When My Task On Earth Is Done,
When By Thy Grace The Victory'S Won,
E'En Death'S Cold Wave I Will Not Flee,
Since God Through Jordan Leadeth Me.
