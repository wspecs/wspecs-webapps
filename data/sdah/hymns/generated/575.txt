575 - Let Your Heart Be Broken


1
Let Your Heart Be Broken For A World In Need:
Feed The Mouths That Hunger,
Soothe The Wounds That Bleed,
Give The Cup Of Water And The Loaf Of Bread
Be The Hands Of Jesus, Serving In His Stead.

2
Here On Earth Applying Principles Of Love,
Visible Expression - God Still Rules Above
Living Illustration Of The Living Word
To The Minds Of All Who'Ve Never Seen Or Heard.

3
Blest To Be A Blessing Privileged To Care,
Challenged By The Need Apparent Everywhere.
Where Mankind Is Wanting, Fill The Vacant Place.
Be The Means Through Which The Lord Reveals His Grace.

4
Add To Your Believing Deeds That Prove It True,
Knowing Christ As Savior, Make Him Master, Too.
Follow In His Footsteps, Go Where He Has Trod;
In The World'S Great Trouble Risk Yourself For God.

5
Let Your Heart Be Tender And Your Vision Clear;
See Mankind As God Sees, Serve Him Far And Near.
Let Your Heart Be Broken By A Brother'S Pain;
Share Your Rich Resources, Give And Give Again.
