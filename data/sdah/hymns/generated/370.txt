370 - Christ For The World


1
Christ For The World We Sing,
The World To Christ We Bring,
With Loving Zeal;
The Poor, And Them That Mourn,
The Faint And Overborne,
Sinsick And Sorrow-Worn,
Whom Christ Doth Heal.

2
Christ For The World We Sing,
The World To Christ We Bring,
With Fervent Prayer;
The Wayward And The Lost,
By Restless Passions Tossed,
Redeemed At Countless Cost,
From Dark Despair.

3
Christ For The World We Sing,
The World To Christ We Bring,
With Joyful Song;
The Newborn Souls, Whose Days,
Reclaimed From Error'S Ways,
Inspired With Hope And Praise,
To Christ Belong.
