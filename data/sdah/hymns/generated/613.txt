613 - Fight The Good Fight


1
Fight The Good Fight With All Thy Might;
Christ Is Thy Strength, And Christ Thy Right;
Lay Hold On Life And It Shall Be
Thy Joy And Crown Eternally.

2
Run The Straight Race Through God'S Good Grace;
Lift Up Thine Eyes, And Seek His Face.
Life With Its Path Before Us Lies;
Christ Is The Way, And Christ The Prize.

3
Cast Care Aside, Lean On Thy Guide,
His Boundless Mercy Will Provide;
Trust, And The Trusting Soul Shall Prove
Christ Is Its Life, And Christ Its Love.

4
Faint Not, Nor Fear, His Arms Are Near;
He Changeth Not, And Thou Art Dear.
Only Believe, And Thou Shalt See
That Christ Is All In All To Thee.
