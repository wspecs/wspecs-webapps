367 - Rescue The Perishing


1
Rescue The Perishing, Care For The Dying,
Snatch Them In Pity From Sin And The Grave;
Weep O'Er The Erring One, Lift Up The Fallen,
Tell Them Of Jesus, The Mighty To Save.

Refrain
Rescue The Perishing, Care For The Dying;
Jesus Is Merciful, Jesus Will Save.

2
Though They Are Slighting Him, Still He Is Waiting,
Waiting The Penitent Child To Receive;
Plead With Them Earnestly, Plead With Them Gently;
He Will Forgive If They Only Believe.

3
Rescue The Perishing, Duty Demands It;
Strength For Thy Labor The Lord Will Provide;
Back To The Narrow Way Patiently Win Them;
Tell The Poor Wanderer A Savior Has Died.
