184 - Jesus Paid It All


1
I Hear The Savior Say,
"Thy Strength Indeed Is Small;
Child Of Weakness, Watch And Pray,
Find In Me Thine All In All."

Refrain
Jesus Paid It All,
All To Him I Owe;
Sin Had Left A Crimson Stain,
He Washed It White As Snow.

2
Lord, Now Indeed I Find
Thy Power And Thine Alone,
Can Change The Leper'S Spots
And Melt The Heart Of Stone.

3
Since Nothing Good Have I
Whereby Thy Grace To Claim,
I'Ll Wash My Garments White
In The Blood Of Calv'Ry'S Lamb.

4
And When Before The Throne
I Stand In Him Complete,
I'Ll Lay My Trophies Down
All Down At Jesus' Feet.
