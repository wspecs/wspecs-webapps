182 - Christ Is Alive


1
Christ Is Alive!
Let Christians Sing.
His Cross Stands Empty To The Sky.
Let Streets And Homes With Praises Ring.
His Love In Death Shall Never Die.

2
Christ Is Alive!
No Longer Bound
To Distant Years In Palestine,
He Comes To Claim The Here And Now
And Conquer Every Place And Time.

3
In Every Insult,
Rift, And War
Where Color, Scorn Or Wealth Divide,
He Suffers Still, Yet Loves The More,
And Lives, Though Ever Crucified.

4
Christ Is Alive!
Ascended Lord
He Rules The World His Father Made,
Till, In The End, His Love Adored
Shall Be To All On Earth Displayed.
