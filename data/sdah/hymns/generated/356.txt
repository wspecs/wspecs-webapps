356 - All Who Love And Serve Your City


1
All Who Love And Serve Your City,
All Who Bear Its Daily Stress,
All Who Cry For Peace And Justice,
All Who Curse And All Who Bless.

2
In Your Day Of Loss And Sorrow,
In Your Day Of Helpless Strife,
Honor, Peace, And Love Retreating,
Seek The Lord, Who Is Your Life.

3
For All Days Are Days Of Judgment,
And The Lord Is Waiting Still,
Drawing Near His Friends Who Spurn Him,
Off'Ring Peace From Calv'Ry'S Hill.

4
Risen Lord, Shall Yet The City
Be The City Of Despair?
Come Today, Our Judge, Our Glory;
Be Its Name "The Lord Is There!"
