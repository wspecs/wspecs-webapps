144 - O Sing A Song Of Bethlehem


1
O Sing A Song Of Bethlehem,
Of Shepherds Watching There,
And Of The News That Came To Them
From Angels In The Air:
The Light That Shone On Bethlehem
Fills All The World Today;
Of Jesus'Birth And Peace On Earth
The Angels Sing Alway.

2
O Sing A Song Of Nazareth,
Of Sunny Days Of Joy,
O Sing Of Fragrant Flowers Breath,
And Of The Sinless Boy:
For Now The Flowers Of Nazareth
In Every Heart May Grow;
Now Spreads The Fame Of His Dear Name
On All The Winds That Blow.

3
O Sing A Song Of Calvary,
Its Glory And Dismay;
Of Him Who Hung Upon The Tree,
And Took Our Sins Away:
For He Who Died On Calvary
Is Risen From The Grave;
And Christ, Our Lord, By Heaven Adored,
Is Mighty Now To Save.
