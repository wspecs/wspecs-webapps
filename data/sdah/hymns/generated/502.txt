502 - Sun Of My Soul


1
Sun Of My Soul, O Savior Dear!
It Is Not Night If Thou Be Near;
O May No Earth-Born Cloud Arise
To Hide Thee From Thy Servant'S Eyes.

2
When Soft The Dews Of Kindly Sleep
My Weary Eyelids Gently Steep,
Be My Last Thought How Sweet To Rest
Forever On My Savior'S Breast!

3
Abide With Me From Morn Till Eve,
For Without Thee I Cannot Live;
Abide With Me When Night Is Nigh,
For Without Thee I Dare Not Die.

4
Be Near And Bless Me When I Wake,
Ere Through The World My Way I Take;
Till In The Ocean Of Thy Love
I Lose Myself In Heaven Above.
