513 - In Heavenly Love Abiding


1
In Heavenly Love Abiding,
No Change My Heart Shall Fear;
And Safe Is Such Confiding,
For Nothing Changes Here.
The Storm May Roar Without Me,
My Heart May Low Be Laid;
But God Is Round About Me,
And Can I Be Dismayed?

2
Wherever He May Guide Me,
No Want Shall Turn Me Back;
My Shepherd Is Besided Me,
And Nothing Can I Lack.
His Wisdom Ever Waketh,
His Sight Is Never Dim;
He Knows The Way He Taketh,
And I Will Walk With Him.

3
Green Pastures Are Before Me,
Which Yet I Have Not Seen;
Bright Skies Will Soon Be O'Er Me,
Where Darkest Clouds Have Been.
My Hope I Cannot Measure,
My Path To Life Is Free;
My Savior Has My Teasure,
And He Will Walk With Me.
