167 - Alleluia! Sing To Jesus!


1
Alleluia! Sing To Jesus!
His The Scepter, His The Throne.
Alleluia! His The Triumph,
His The Victory Alone.
Hark! The Songs Of Peaceful Zion
Thunder Like A Mighty Flood.
Jesus Out Of Every Nation
Has Redeemed Us By His Blood.

2
Alleluia! Not As Orphans
Are We Left In Sorrow Now;
Alleluia! He Is Near Us,
Faith Believes, Nor Questions How;
Though The Cloud From Sight Received
Him When The Forty Days Were O'Er
Shall Our Hearts Forget His Promise,
"I Am With You Evermore"?

3
Alleluia! Bread Of Angels,
Thou On Earth Our Food, Our Stay;
Alleluia! Here The Sinful Flee
To Thee From Day To Day:
Intercessor, Friend Of Sinners,
Earth'S Redeemer, Plead For Me,
Where The Songs Of All The Sinless
Sweep Across The Crystal Sea.
