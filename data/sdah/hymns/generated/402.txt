402 - By Christ Redeemed


1
By Christ Redeemed, In Christ Restored,
We Keep The Memory Adored,
And Show The Death Of Our Dear Lord,
Until He Come.

2
His Broken Body In Our Stead Is Here,
In His Memorial Bread;
And So Our Feeble Love Is Fed,
Until He Come.

3
His Fearful Drops Of Agony,
His Lifeblood Shed For Us We See;
The Wine Shall Tell The Mystery,
Until He Come.

4
And Thus That Dark Betrayal Night,
With The Last Advent We Unite
The Shame, The Glory, By This Rite,
Until He Come.
