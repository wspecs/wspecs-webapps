113 - As Pants The Hart


1
As Pants The Hart For Cooling Streams
When Heated In The Chase,
So Longs My Soul, O God, For Thee,
And Thy Refreshing Grace.

2
For Thee, My God, The Living God,
My Thirsty Soul Doth Pine:
O When Shall I Behold Thy Face,
Thou Majesty Divine?

3
Why Restless, Why Cast Down, My Soul?
Hope Still, And Thou Shalt Sing
The Praise Of Him Who Is Thy God,
Thy Health'S Eternal Spring.

4
To Father, Son, And Holy Ghost,
The God Whom We Adore,
Be Glory, As It Was, Is Now,
And Shall Be Evermore.
