615 - Rise Up, O Church Of God


1
Rise Up, O Men Of God!
His Kingdom Tarries Long.
Bring In The Day Of Brotherhood
And End The Night Of Wrong.

2
Let Women All Rise Up!
Have Done With Lesser Things.
Give Heart And Mind And Soul And Strength
To Serve The King Of Kings.

3
Rise Up, Courageous Youth!
The Church For You Doth Wait,
Her Strength Unequal To Her Task;
Rise Up, And Make Her Great!

4
Lift High The Cross Of Christ!
Tread Where His Feet Have Trod.
Disciples Of The Son Of Man,
Rise Up, O Church Of God!
