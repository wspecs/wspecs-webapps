049 - Savior, Breathe An Evening Blessing


1
Savior, Breathe An Evening Blessing,
Ere Repose Our Spirits Seal;
Sin And Want We Come Confessing;
Thou Canst Save, And Thou Canst Heal.

2
Though The Night Be Dark And Dreary,
Darkness Cannot Hide From Thee;
Thou Art He Who, Never Weary,
Watchest Where Thy People Be.

3
Though Destruction Walk Around Us.
Though The Arrow Past Us Fly,
Angel Guards From Thee Surround Us,
We Are Safe If Thou Art Nigh.

4
Should Swift Death This Night O'Re-Take Us,
And Our Couch Become Our Tomb,
May The Morn Of Glory Wake Us,
Clad In Light And Deathless Bloom.
