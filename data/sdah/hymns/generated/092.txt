092 - This Is My Father'S World


1
This Is My Father'S World,
And To My Listening Ears
All Nature Sings, And Round Me Rings
The Music Of The Spheres.
This Is My Father'S World:
I Rest Me In The Thought
Of Rocks And Trees, Of Skies And Seas;
His Hand The Wonders Wrought.

2
This Is My Father'S World,
The Birds Their Carols Raise,
The Morning Light, The Lily White,
Declare Their Maker'S Praise.
This Is My Father'S World:
He Shines In All That'S Fair;
In The Rustling Grass I Hear Him Pass;
He Speaks To Me Everywhere.

3
This Is My Father'S World.
O Let Me Ne'Er Forget
That Though The Wrong Seems Oft So Strong,
God Is The Ruler Yet.
This Is My Father'S World:
Why Should My Heart Be Sad?
The Lord Is King; Let The Heavens Ring!
God Reigns; Let The Earth Be Glad!
