067 - O Lord, Now Let Your Servant


1
O Lord, Now Let Your Servant
Depart In Heav'Nly Peace,
For I Have Seen The Glory
Of Your Redeeming Grace:
A Light To Lead The Gentiles
Unto Your Holy Hill,
The Glory Of Your People,
Your Chosen Israel.

2
Then Grant That I May Follow Your Gleam,
O Glorious Light,
Till Earthly Shadows Scatter,
And Faith Is Changed To Sight;
Till Raptured Saints Shall Gather
Upon That Shining Shore,
Where Christ, The Blessed Day Star,
Shall Light Them Evermore.
