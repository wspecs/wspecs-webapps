298 - I Lay My Sins On Jesus


1
I Lay My Sins On Jesus,
The Spotless Lamb Of God;
He Bears Them All, And Frees Us
From The Accursed Load,
From The Accursed Load.

2
I Bring My Guilt To Jesus,
To Wash My Crimson Stains
White In His Blood Most Precious
Till Not A Stain Remains,
Till Not A Stain Remains.

3
I Lay My Wants On Jesus,
All Fullness Dwells In Him;
He Healeth My Diseases
He Doth My Soul Redeem,
He Doth My Soul Redeem

4
I Long To Be With Jesus,
Meek, Loving, Lowly, Mild;
I Long To Be Like Jesus
The Father'S Holy Child,
The Father'S Holy Child.

5
I Long To Be With Jesus
Amid The Heav'Nly Throng,
To Sing With Them His Praises,
And Learn The Angels' Song.
And Learn The Angels' Song.
