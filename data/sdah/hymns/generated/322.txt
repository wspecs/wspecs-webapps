322 - Nothing Between


1
Nothing Between My Soul And My Savior,
Naught Of This World'S Delusive Dream;
I Have Renounced All Sinful Pleasure;
Jesus Is Mine, There'S Nothing Between.

Refrain
Nothing Between My Soul And My Savior,
So That His Blessed Face May Be Seen;
Nothing Preventing The Least Of His Favor;
Keep The Way Clear! Let Nothing Between.

2
Nothing Between, Like Worldly Pleasure;
Habits Of Life, Though Harmless They Seem,
Must Not My Heart From Him Ever Sever;
He Is My All, There'S Nothing Between.

3
Nothing Between, E'En Many Hard Trials,
Though The Whole World Against Me Convene;
Watching With Prayer And Much Self Denial,
I'Ll Triumph At Last, There'S Nothing Between.
