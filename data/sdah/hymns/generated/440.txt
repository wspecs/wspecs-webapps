How Cheering Is The Christian'S Hope,
While Toiling Here Below!
It Bouys Us Up While This Passing Through
This Wilderness Of Woe,

It Bouys Us Up While This Passing Through
This Wilderness Of Woe,
It Bouys Us Up While Passing Through
This Wilderness Of Woe.

It Points Us To A Land Of Rest,
Where Saints With Christ Will Reign;
Where We Shall Meet The Loved Of Earth,
And Never Part Again.

Fly, Lingering Moments, Fly, O, Fly,
Dear Savior, Quickly Come!
We Long To See Thee As Thou Art,
And Reach That Blissful Home.
