326 - Open My Eyes That I May See


1
Open My Eyes, That I May See
Glimpses Of Truth Thou Hast For Me;
Place In My Hands The Wonderful Key
That Shall Unclasp And Set Me Free.
Silently Now I Wait For Thee,
Ready, My God, Thy Will To See;
Open My Eyes,
Illumine Me, Spirit Divine!

2
Open My Ears That I May Hear
Voices Of Truth Thou Sendest Clear;
And While The Wavenotes Fall On My Ear,
Everything False Will Disappear.
Silently Now I Wait For Thee,
Ready, My God, Thy Will To See;
Open My Ears, Illumine Me, Spirit Divine!

3
Open My Mouth, And Let Me Bear
Gladly The Warm Truth Everywhere;
Open My Heart, And Let Me Prepare
Love With Thy Children Thus To Share.
Silently Now I Wait For Thee,
Ready, My God, Thy Will To See;
Open My Heart, Illumine Me, Spirit Divine!
