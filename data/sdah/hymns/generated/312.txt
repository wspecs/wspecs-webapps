312 - Near The Cross


1
Jesus, Keep Me Near The Cross;
There A Precious Fountain,
Free To All, A Healing Stream,
Flows From Calvary'S Mountain.

Refrain
In The Cross, In The Cross,
Be My Glory Ever,
Till My Raptured Soul Shall Find
Rest Beyond The River.

2
Near The Cross, A Trembling Soul,
Love And Mercy Found Me;
There The Bright And Morning Star
Sheds Its Beams Around Me.

3
Near The Cross! O Lamb Of God,
Bring Its Scenes Before Me;
Help Me Walk From Day To Day
With Its Shadow O'Er Me.

4
Near The Cross I'Ll Watch And Wait,
Hoping, Trusting Ever,
Till I Reach The Golden Strand
