600 - Hold Fast Till I Come


1
Sweet Promise Is Given To All Who Believe-
"Behold I Come Quickly, Mine Own To Receive;
Hold Fast Till I Come; The Danger Is Great;
Sleep Not As Do Others; Be Watchful, And Wait."

Refrain
"Hold Fast Till I Come," Sweet Promise Of Heaven-
"The Kingdom Restored, To You Shall Be Given."
"Come, Enter My Joy, Sit Down On The Throne;
Bright Crowns Are In Waiting; Hold Fast Till I Come."

2
We'Ll "Watch Unto Prayer" With Lamps Burning Bright;
He Comes To All Others A "Thief In The Night."
We Know He Is Near, But Know Not The Day-
As Spring Shows That Summer Is Not Far Away.

3
Yes! This Is Our Hope, 'Tis Built On His Word-
The Glorious Appearing Of Jesus, Our Lord;
Of Promises All, It Stands As The Sum:
"Behold I Come Quickly; Hold Fast Till I Come."
