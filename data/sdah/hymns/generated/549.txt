549 - Loving Shepherd Of Thy Sheep


1
Loving Shepherd Of Thy Sheep,
Keep Thy Lamb, In Safety Keep;
Nothing Can Thy Power Withstand;
None Can Pluck Me From Thy Hand.

2
Loving Shepherd, Ever Near,
Teach Thy Lamb Thy Voice To Hear;
Suffer Not My Steps To Stray
From The Straight And Narrow Way.

3
Where Thou Leadest I Would Go,
Walking In Thy Steps Below,
Till Within The Heavenly Fold
I My Shepherd Shall Behold.
