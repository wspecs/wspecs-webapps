548 - Now Praise The Hidden God Of Love


1
Now Praise The Hidden God Of Love
In Whom We All Must Live And Move,
Who Shepherds Us, At Every Stage
Thro' Youth, Maturity, And Age.

2
Who Challenged Us, When Were Young
To Storm The Citadels Of Wrong;
In Care For Others Taught Us How
God'S True Community Must Grow.

3
Who Bids Us Never Lose Our Zest,
Tho' Age Is Urging Us To Rest,
But Proves To Us That We Have Still
A Work To Do, A Place To Fill.

4
Then Talk No More Of Wasted Time,
But Godward Look, And Upward Climb,
Content To Sleep, When Day Is Done,
And Rise Refreshed, And Travel On.
