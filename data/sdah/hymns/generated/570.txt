570 - Not I, But Christ


1
Not I, But Christ, Be Honored, Loved, Exalted;
Not I, But Christ, Be Seen, Be Known, Be Heard;
Not I, But Christ, In Every Look And Action,
Not I, But Christ, In Every Thought And Word.

2
Not I, But Christ, To Gently Soothe In Sorrow,
Not I, But Christ, To Wipe The Falling Tear;
Not I, But Christ, To Lift The Weary Burden,
Not I, But Christ, To Hush Away All Fear.

3
Christ, Only Christ! No Idle Words E'Er Falling,
Christ, Only Christ; No Needless Bustling Sound;
Christ, Only Christ, No Self Important Bearing;
Christ, Only Christ, No Trace Of "I" Be Found.

4
Not I, But Christ, My Every Need Supplying,
Not I, But Christ, My Strength And Health To Be;
Christ, Only Christ, For Body, Soul, And Spirit,
Christ, Only Christ, Here And Eternally.
