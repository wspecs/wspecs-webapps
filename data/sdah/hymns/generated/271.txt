271 - Break Thou The Bread Of Life


1
Break Thou The Bread Of Life, Dear Lord, To Me,
As Thou Didst Break The Loaves Beside The Sea;
Beyond The Sacred Page I Seek Thee, Lord;
My Spirit Pants For Thee, O Living Word!

2
Bless Thou The Truth, Dear Lord, To Me, To Me,
As Thou Didst Bless The Bread By Galilee;
Then Shall All Bondage Cease, All Fetters Fall;
And I Shall Find My Peace, My All In All.

3
Thou Art The Bread Of Life, O Lord, To Me;
Thy Holy Word The Truth That Saveth Me;
Give Me To Eat And Live With Thee Above;
Teach Me To Love Thy Truth, For Thou Art Love.

4
Spirit And Life Are They, Words Thou Dost Speak;
I Hasten To Obey, But I Am Weak;
Thou Art My Only Help, Thou Art My Life;
Heeding Thy Holy Word I Win The Strife.
