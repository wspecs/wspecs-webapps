037 - O Sing, My Soul, Your Maker'S Praise


1
O Sing My Soul, Your Maker'S Praise
In Grateful Hymns Ascending;
Whose Steadfast Love Has Crowned Your Days
With Heav'Nly Gifts Un Ending.
I Sought The Lord, He Heard My Cry;
His Holy Angels Hover Nigh
The Tents Of Those Who Love Him.

2
The Lord Is Good To Those Who Seek
His Face In Time Of Sorrow,
Providing Comfort To The Weak
And Grace For Each Tomorrow.
Though Grief May Tarry For A Night,
The Morn Shall Break In Joy And Light
With Blessings From His Presence.

3
The Lord Will Turn His Face In Peace
When Troubled Souls Draw Near Him;
His Loving Kindness Shall Not Cease
To Those Who Trust And Fear Him.
Our God Will Not Forsake His Own;
Eternal Is His Heav'Nly Throne;
His Kingdom Stands Forever.
