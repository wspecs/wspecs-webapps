382 - O Day Of Rest And Gladness


1
O Day Of Rest And Gladness,
O Day Of Joy And Light,
O Balm Of Care And Sadness,
Most Beautiful, Most Bright;
On Thee, The High And Lowly,
Who Bend Before Throne,
Sing, "Holy, Holy, Holy,"
To The Eternal One.

2
Thou Art A Port Protected
From Storms That Round Us Rise;
A Garden Intersected
With Streams Of Paradise;
Thou Art A Cooling Fountain
In Life'S Dry, Dreary Sand;
From Thee, Like Pisgah'S Mountain,
We View Our Promised Land.

3
A Day Of Sweet Reflection,
Thou Art A Day Of Love,
A Day To Raise Affection
From Earth To Things Above.
New Graces Ever Gaining
From This Our Day Of Rest,
We Reach The Rest Remaining
In Mansions Of The Blessed.
