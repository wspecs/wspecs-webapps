629 - O Happy Band Of Pilgrims


1
O Happy Band Of Pilgrims,
If Onward Ye Will Tread
With Jesus As Your Fellow,
To Jesus As Your Head!

2
O Happy If Ye Labor
As Jesus Did For Men;
O Happy If Ye Hunger
As Jesus Hungered Then!

3
The Trials That Beset You,
The Sorrows Ye Endure,
The Manifold Temptations
That Death Alone Can Cure,

4
What Are They But His Jewels
Of Right Celestial Worth?
What Are They But The Ladder
Set Up To Heaven On Earth?

5
O Happy Band Of Pilgrims,
Look Upward To The Skies,
Where Such A Light Affliction
Shall Win You Such A Prize!
