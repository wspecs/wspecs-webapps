340 - Jesus Saves


1
We Have Heard A Joyful Sound,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
Spread The Gladness All Around,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
Bear The News To Every Land,
Climb The Steeps And Cross The Waves,
Onward, 'Tis Our Lord'S Command,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves.

2
Waft It On The Rolling Tide,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
Tell To Sinners, Far And Wide,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
Sing, Ye Islands Of The Sea.
Echo Back, Ye Ocean Caves,
Earth Shall Keep Her Jubilee,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves.

3
Sing Above The Battle'S Strife,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
By His Death And Endless Life,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
Sing It Softly Through The Gloom,
When The Heart For Mercy Craves,
Sing In Triumph O'Er The Tomb,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves.

4
Give The Winds A Mighty Voice,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
Let The Nations Now Rejoice,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves;
Shout Salvation Full And Free,
Highest Hills And Deepest Caves,
This Our Song Of Victory,
Jesus Saves, Jesus Saves.
