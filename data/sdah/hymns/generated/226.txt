226 - Lift Up Your Heads


1
Lift Up Your Heads, Ye Mighty Gates!
Behold The King Of Glory Waits;
The King Of Kings Is Drawing Near,
The Savior Of The World Is Here.

2
The Lord Is Just, A Helper Tried;
Mercy Is Ever At His Side;
His Kingly Crowns Is Holiness,
His Scepter, Pity In Distress.

3
O Blest The Land, The City Blest,
Where Christ The Ruler Is Confessed!
O Happy Hearts And Happy Homes
To Whom This King In Triumph Comes!

4
Fling Wide The Portals Of Your Heart;
Make It A Temple, Set Apart
From Earthly Use For Heaven'S Employ,
Adorned With Prayer, And Love, And Joy.

5
Redeemer, Come; I Open Wide
My Heart To Thee; Here, Lord, Abide.
Let Me Thy Inner Presence Feel,
Thy Grace And Love In Me Reveal.
