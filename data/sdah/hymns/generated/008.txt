008 - We Gather Together


1
We Gather Together To Ask The Lord'S Blessing;
He Chastens And Hastens His Will To Make Known.
The Wicked Oppressing Now Cease From Distressing.
Sing Praises To His Name; He Forgets Not His Own.

2
Beside Us To Guide Us, Our God With Us Joining,
Ordaining, Maintaining His Kingdom Divine;
So From The Beginning The Fight We Were Winning;
Thou, Lord, Were At Our Side, All Glory Be Thine!

3
We All Do Extol Thee, Thou Leader Triumphant,
And Pray That Thou Still Our Defender Wilt Be.
Let Thy Congregation Escape Tribulation;
Thy Name Be Ever Praised! O Lord, Make Us Free!
