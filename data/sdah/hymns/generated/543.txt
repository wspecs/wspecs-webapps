543 - Jesus, Friend Of Little Children


1
Jesus, Friend Of Little Children,
Be A Friend To Me;
Take My Hand And Ever Keep Me
Close To Thee.

2
Teach Me How To Grow In Goodness,
Daily As I Grow;
Thou Hast Been A Child, And Surely
Thou Dost Know.

3
Step By Step, O, Lead Me Onward,
Upward Into Youth;
Wiser, Stronger, Still Becoming
In Thy Truth.

4
Never Leave Me, Nor Forsake Me;
Ever Be My Friend;
For I Need Thee From Life'S Dawning
To Its End.
