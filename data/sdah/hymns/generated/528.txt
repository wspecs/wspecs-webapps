528 - A Shelter In The Time Of Storm


1
The Lord'S Our Rock, In Him We Hide,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm;
Secure Whatever Ill Betide,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm.

Refrain
Mighty Rock In A Weary Land,
Cooling Shade On The Burning Sand,
Faithful Guide For The Pilgrim Band-
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm.

2
A Shade By Day, Defense By Night,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm;
No Fears Alarm, No Foes Afright,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm.

3
The Raging Storms May Round Us Beat,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm
We'Ll Never Leave Our Safe Retreat,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm.

4
O Rock Divine, O Refuge Dear,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm;
Be Thou Our Helper Ever Near,
A Shelter In The Time Of Storm.
