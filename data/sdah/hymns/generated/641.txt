641 - God In His Love For Us


1
God In His Love For Us Lent Us This Planet,
Gave It A Purpose In Time And In Space:
Small As A Spark From The Fire Of Creation,
Cradle Of Life And The Home Of Our Race.

2
Thanks Be To God For Its Bounty And Beauty,
Life That Sustains Us In Body And Mind:
Plenty For All, If We Learn How To Share It,
Riches Undreamed Of To Fathom And Find.

3
Long Have Our Human Wars Ruined Its Harvest;
Long Has Earth Bowed To The Terror Of Forced;
Long Have We Wasted What Others Have Need Of,
Poisoned The Fountain Of Life At Its Source.

4
Earth Is The Lord'S: It Is Ours To Enjoy It,
Ours, As His Stewards, To Farm And Defend.
From Its Pollution, Misuse, And Destruction,
Good Lord, Deliver Us, World Without End!
