536 - God, Who Stretched


1
God, Who Stretched The Spangled Heavens
Infinite In Time And Place,
Flung The Suns In Burning Radiance
Through The Silent Fields Of Space;
We, Your Children In Your Likeness,
Share Inventive Powers With You;
Great Creator, Still Creating,
Show Us What We Yet May Do.

2
We Have Ventured Worlds Undreamed Of
Since The Childhood Of Our Race;
Knowing The Ecstasy Of Winging
Through Untraveled Realms Of Space,
Probed The Secrets Of The Atom,
Yielding Unimagined Power,
Facing Us With Life'S Destruction
Or Our Most Triumphant Hour.

3
As Each Far Horizon Beckons,
May It Challenge Us Anew:
Children Of Creative Purpose,
Serving Others, Honoring You.
May Our Dreams Prove Rich With Promise;
Each Endeavor Well Begun;
Great Creator, Give Us Guidance
Till Our Goals And Yours Are One.
