103 - O God, Our Help


1
O God, Our Help In Ages Past,
Our Hope For Years To Come,
Our Shelter From The Stormy Blast,
And Our Eternal Home!

2
Under The Shadow Of Thy Throne,
Still May We Dwell Secure;
Sufficient Is Thine Arm Alone,
And Our Defense Is Sure.

3
Before The Hills In Order Stood,
Or Earth Received Her Frame,
From Everlasting, Thou Art God,
To Endless Years The Same.

4
A Thousand Ages, In Thy Sight,
Are Like An Evening Gone;
Short As The Watch That Ends The Night,
Before The Rising Sun.

5
O God, Our Help In Ages Past,
Our Hope For Years To Come;
Be Thou Our Guide While Life Shall Last,
And Our Eternal Home!
