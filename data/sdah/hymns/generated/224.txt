224 - Seek Ye First The Kingdom


1
Seek Ye First The Kingdom,
'Tis Your Father'S Will.
So The Voice Of Jesus Bids Us Follow Still.
Saviour, We Would Hear Thee,
Follow, Find, And See;
And In Life'S Adventure Thy Disciples Be.

2
As For Hidden Treasure,
Or For Matchless Pearl,
When At Last Discovered,
Some Will Sell Their All;
So, When Breaks The Vision Of That
Kingdom Fair,
Ours Shall Be Its Riches And Its Beauty Rare.

3
As The Silent Leaven Works Its Secret Way,
Or As Grows The Seed Grain
Through The Night And Day;
Lord, So Be The Increase, Peaceable But Sure,
Of Thy Word Within Us,
And Thy Kingdom'S Power.

4
As The Tender Seedling Grows Up
Tall And Strong,
And The Birds Of Heaven To Its
Branches Throng; So Shall All God'S Children,
From The East And West,
Gather To His Kingdom, In Its Shadow Rest.

5
Humblest Shall Be Greatest,
Poor In Spirit Reign;
Home Shall Come The Childlike,
Born Through Thee Again;
Eager Hearts Arrive There On The
Pilgrim'S Road,
Hail! The Kingdom Glorious Of The Living God!
