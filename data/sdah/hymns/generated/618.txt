618 - Stand Up! Stand Up For Jesus!


1
Stand Up, Stand Up For Jesus!
Ye Soldiers Of The Cross;
Lift High His Royal Banner,
It Must Not Suffer Loss:
From Vict'Ry Unto Vict'Ry,
His Army Shall He Lead,
Till Every Foe Is Vanquished,
And Christ Is Lord Indeed.

2
Stand Up, Stand Up For Jesus!
The Trumpet Call Obey:
Forth To The Mighty Conflict,
In This His Glorious Day;
Ye That Are Men Now Serve Him
Against Unnumbered Foes;
Let Courage Rise With Danger,
And Strength To Strength Oppose.

3
Stand Up, Stand Up For Jesus!
Stand In His Strength Alone,
The Arm Of Flesh Will Fail You,
Ye Dare Not Trust Your Own;
Put On The Gospel Armor,
And Watching Unto Prayer,
Where Calls The Voice Of Duty,
Be Never Wanting There.

4
Stand Up, Stand Up For Jesus!
The Strife Will Not Be Long;
This Day The Noise Of Battle,
The Next The Victor'S Song;
To Him That Overcometh
A Crown Of Life Shall Be;
He With The King Of Glory
Shall Reign Eternally.
