105 - Sing To The Great Jehovah'S Praise


1
Sing To The Great Jehovah'S Praise!
All Praise To Him Belongs;
Who Kindly Lengthens Out Our Days,
In Spires Our Choicest Songs,
Inspires Our Choicest Songs.

2
His Providence Hath Brought Us Through
Another Various Year;
We All, With Vows And Anthems New,
Before Our God Appear,
Before Our God Appear.

3
O God, Thy Mercies Past We Own,
And Thy Continued Care;
To Thee Presenting Through Thy Son
What E'Er We Have And Are,
What E'Er We Have And Are.
