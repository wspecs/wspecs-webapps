520 - He Hideth My Soul


1
A Wonderful Savior Is Jesus My Lord,
A Wonderful Savior To Me,
He Hideth My Soul In The Cleft Of The Rock,
Where Rivers Of Pleasure I See.

Refrain
He Hideth My Soul In The Cleft Of The Rock
That Shadows A Dry, Thirsty Land;
He Hideth My Life In The Depths Of His Love,
And Covers Me There With His Hand,
And Covers Me There With His Hand.

2
A Wonderful Savior Is Jesus My Lord,
He Taketh My Burden Away,
He Holdeth Me Up, And I Shall Not Be Moved,
He Giveth Me Strength As My Day.

3
With Numberless Blessings Each Moment He Crowns,
And Filled With His Fullness Divine,
I Sing In My Rapture, Oh, Glory To God
For Such A Redeemer As Mine.

4
When Clothed In His Brightness, Transported I Rise
To Meet Him In Clouds Of The Sky,
His Perfect Salvation, His Wonderful Love,
I'Ll Shout With The Millions On High.
