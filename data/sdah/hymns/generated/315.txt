315 - O For A Closer Walk!


1
O For A Closer Walk With God,
A Calm And Heavenly Frame,
A Light To Shine Upon The Road
That Leads Me To The Lamb!

2
Return, O Holy Dove, Return,
Sweet Messenger Of Rest!
I Hate The Sins That Made Thee Mourn
And Drove Thee From My Breast.

3
What Peaceful Hours I Once Enjoyed!
How Sweet Their Memory Still!
But They Have Left An Aching Void
The World Can Never Fill.

4
The Dearest Idol I Have Known,
What-E'Er That Idol Be,
Help Me To Tear It From Thy Throne,
And Worship Only Thee.
