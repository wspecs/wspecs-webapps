273 - Lord, I Have Made Thy Word My Choice


1
Lord, I Have Made Thy Word My Choice,
My Lasting Heritage;
There Shall My Noblest Powers Rejoice,
My Warmest Thoughts Engage.

2
I'Ll Read The Histories Of Thy Love,
And Keep Thy Laws In Sight;
While Through Thy Promises I Rove,
With Ever Fresh Delight.

3
In This Broad Land Of Wealth Unknown,
Where Springs Of Life Arise,
Seeds Of Immortal Bliss Are Sown,
And Hidden Glory Lies.

4
The Best Relief That Mourners Have,
It Makes Our Sorrows Blest;
Our Fairest Hope Beyond The Grave,
And Our Eternal Rest.
