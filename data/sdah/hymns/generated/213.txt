213 - Jesus Is Coming Again


1
Lift Up The Trumpet, And Loud Let It Ring:
Jesus Is Coming Again!
Cheer Up, Ye Pilgrims, Be Joyful And Sing:
Jesus Is Coming Again!

Refrain
Coming Again, Coming Again,
Jesus Is Coming Again!

2
Echo It, Hilltops; Proclaim It, Ye Plains:
Jesus Is Coming Again!
Coming In Glory, The Lamb That Was Slain;
Jesus Is Coming Again!

3
Heavings Of Earth, Tell The Vast, Wondering Throng:
Jesus Is Coming Again!
Tempests And Whirlwinds, The Anthem Prolong;
Jesus Is Coming Again!

4
Nations Are Angry-By This We Do Know
Jesus Is Coming Again!
Knowledge Increases; Men Run To And Fro;
Jesus Is Coming Again!
