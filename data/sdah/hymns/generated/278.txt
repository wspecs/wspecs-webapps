278 - Lord Jesus, Once You Spoke To Men


1
Lord Jesus, Once You Spoke To Men
Upon The Mountain And The Plain,
O Help Us Listen Now As Then
And Wonder At Your Words Again.

2
We All Have Secret Fears To Face,
Our Minds And Motives To Amend.
We Seek Your Truth,
We Need Your Grace,
Our Living Lord And Present Friend.

3
The Gospel Speaks; And We Receive
Your Light, Your Love,
Your Own Command.
O Help Us Live What We Believe,
In Daily Word Of Heart And Hand.
