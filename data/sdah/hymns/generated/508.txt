508 - Anywhere With Jesus


1
Anywhere With Jesus I Can Safely Go,
Anywhere He Leads Me In This World Below;
Anywhere Without Him Dearest Joys Would Fade;
Anywhere With Jesus I Am Not Afraid.

Refrain
Anywhere, Anywhere! Fear I Cannot Know;
Anywhere With Jesus I Can Safely Go.

2
Anywhere With Jesus I Am Not Alone;
Other Friends May Fail Me, He Is Still My Own;
Though His Hand May Lead Me Over Drearest Ways,
Anywhere With Jesus Is A House Of Praise.

3
Anywhere With Jesus I Can Go To Sleep,
When The Darkening Shadows Round About Me Creep,
Knowing I Shall Waken Nevermore To Roam;
Anywhere With Jesus Will Be Home, Sweet Home.
