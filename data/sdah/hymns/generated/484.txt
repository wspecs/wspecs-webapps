484 - I Need Thee, Precious Jesus


1
I Need Thee Precious Jesus, For I Am Very Poor;
A Stranger And A Pilgrim, I Have No Earthly Store.
I Need The Love Of Jesus To Cheer Me On My Way,
To Guide My Doubting Foot Steps,
To Be My Strength And Stay.

2
I Need The Heart Of Jesus To Feel Each Anxious Care,
To Tell My Every Trial, And All My Sorrows Share.
I Need The Holy Spirit To Teach Me What I Am,
To Show Me More Of Jesus,
To Point Me To The Lamb.

3
I Need Thee Precious Jesus, I Hope To See Thee Soon,
Encircled With The Rainbow, And Seated On Thy Throne.
There With Thy Blood-Bought Children, My Joy Shall Ever Be
To Sing Thy Ceaseless Praises,
To Gaze, My Lord, On Thee.
