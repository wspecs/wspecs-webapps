301 - Near, Still Nearer


1
Nearer, Still Nearer, Close To Thy Heart,
Draw Me, My Savior, So Precious Thou Art;
Fold Me, O Fold Me Close To Thy Breast,
Shelter Me Safe In That Haven Of Rest,
Shelter Me Safe In That Haven Of Rest.

2
Nearer, Still Nearer, Nothing I Bring,
Nought As An Offering To Jesus My King-
Only My Sinful Now Contrite Heart,
Grant Me The Cleansing Thy Blood Doth Impart,
Grant Me The Cleansing Thy Blood Doth Impart.

3
Nearer, Still Nearer, Lord, To Be Thine;
Sin, With Its Follies, I Gladly Resign,
All Of Its Pleasures, Pomp And Its Pride;
Give Me But Jesus, My Lord Crucified,
Give Me But Jesus, My Lord Crucified.

4
Nearer, Still Nearer, While Life Shall Last;
Till Safe In Glory My Anchor Is Cast;
Through Endless Ages, Ever To Be,
Nearer, My Savior, Still Nearer To Thee,
Nearer, My Savior, Still Nearer To Thee.
