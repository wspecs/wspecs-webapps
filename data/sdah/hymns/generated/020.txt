1
O Praise Ye The Lord!
Praise Him In The Height;
Rejoice In His Word,
Ye Angels Of Light;
Ye Heavens, Adore Him
By Whom Ye Were Made,
And Worship Before Him,
In Brightness Arrayed.

2
O Praise Ye The Lord!
Praise Him Upon Earth,
In Tuneful Accord:
Ye Sons Of New Birth;
Praise Him Who Hath Brought
You His Grace From Above,
Praise Him Who Hath Taught
You To Sing Of His Love.

3
O Praise Ye The Lord,
All Things That Give Sound;
Each Jubilant Chord,
Re-Echo Around;
Loud Organs His Glory
Forth Tell In Deep Tone,
And Sweet Harp, The Story
Of What He Hath Done.

4
O Praise Ye The Lord!
Thanksgiving And Song
To Him Be Outpoured
All Ages Along:
For Love In Creation,
For Heaven Restored.
For Grace Of Salvation,
O Praise Ye The Lord!
