445 - I'M But A Stranger Here


1
I'M But A Stranger Here,
Heav'N Is My Home;
Earth Is A Desert Drear,
Heav'N Is My Home.
Danger And Sorrow Stand
Round Me On Every Hand;
Heav'N Is My Fatherland,
Heav'N Is My Home.

2
What Though The Tempest Rage,
Heav'N Is My Home;
Short Is My Pilgrimage,
Heav'N Is My Home;
And Time'S Wild Wintry Blast
Soon Shall Be Over Past;
I Shall Reach Home At Last,
Heav'N Is My Home.

3
There At My Savior'S Side
Heav'N Is My Home;
I Shall Be Glorified,
Heav'N Is My Home;
There Are The Good And Blest,
Those I Love Most And Best;
And There I, Too, Shall Rest,
Heav'N Is My Home.
