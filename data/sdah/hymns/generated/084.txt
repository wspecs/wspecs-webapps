084 - God The Omnipotent


1
God The Omnipotent! King, Who Ordainest
Great Winds Thy Clarions, The Lightnings Thy Sword;
Show Forth Thy Pity On High Where Thou Reignest,
Give To Us Peace, O Most Merciful Lord.

2
God The All Merciful! Earth Hath Forsaken
Thy Precepts Holy, And Slighted Thy Word;
Bid Not Thy Wrath In Its Terrors Awaken;
Give To Us Peace, O Most Merciful Lord.

3
God The All Righteousness One! Man Hath Defied Thee;
Yet To Eternity Standeth Thy Word;
Falsehood And Wrong Shall Not Tarry Beside Thee;
Prosper The Right, O Most Merciful Lord.

4
So Shall We Render Thee Thankful Devotion,
For Thy Deliverance From Peril And Sword,
Singing In Chorus From Ocean To Ocean,
"Thine Is The Power And The Glory, O Lord."
