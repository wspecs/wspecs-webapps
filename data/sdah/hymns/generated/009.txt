009 - Let All The World In Every Corner Sing


1
Let All The World In Every Corner Sing, My God And King!
The Heavens Are Not Too High, His Praise May Thither Fly;
The Earth Is Not Too Low, His Praises There May Grow.
Let All The World In Every Corner Sing, My God And King!

2
Let All The World In Every Corner Sing, My God And King!
The Church With Psalms Must Shout,
No Door Can Keep Them Out;
But, Above All, The Heart Must Bear The Longest Part.
Let All The World In Every Corner Sing, My God And King!
