197 - The King Of Love My Shepherd Is


1
The King Of Love My Shepherd Is,
Whose Goodness Faileth Never;
I Nothing Lack If I Am His,
And He Is Mine Forever.

2
Where Streams Of Living Water Flow
My Ransomed Soul He Leadeth,
And, Where The Verdant Pastures Grow,
With Food Celestial Feedeth.

3
Perverse And Foolish, Oft I Strayed,
But Yet In Love He Sought Me,
And On His Shoulder Gently Laid,
And Home, Rejoicing, Brought Me.

4
And So Through All The Length Of Days
Thy Goodness Faileth Never;
Good Shepherd! I Would Sing Thy Praise
Within Thy House Forever.
