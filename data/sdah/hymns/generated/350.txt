350 - Blest Be The Tie That Binds


1
Blest Be The Tie That Binds
Our Hearts In Christian Love;
The Fellowship Of Kindred Minds
Is Like To That Above.

2
Before Our Father'S Throne
We Pour Our Ardent Prayers;
Our Fears, Our Hopes, Our Aims Are One,
Our Comforts And Our Cares.

3
We Share Each Other'S Woes,
Our Mutual Burdens Bear;
And Often For Each Other Flows
The Sympathizing Tear.

4
When We Asunder Part,
It Gives Us Inward Pain;
But We Shall Still Be Joined In Heart,
And Hope To Meet Again.
