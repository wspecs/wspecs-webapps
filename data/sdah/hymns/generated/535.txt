1
I Am Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
Trusting Only Thee;
Trusting Thee For Full Salvation,
Great And Free.

I Am Trusting Thee For Pardon;
At Thy Feet I Bow;
For Thy Grace And Tender Mercy,
Trusting Now.

3
I Am Trusting Thee To Guide Me;
Thou Alone Shalt Lead;
Every Day And Hour Supplying
All My Need.

4
I Am Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
Never Let Me Fall;
I Am Trusting Thee Forever,
And For All.
