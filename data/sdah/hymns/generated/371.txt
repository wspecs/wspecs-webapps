371 - Lift Him Up


1
Lift Him Up, 'Tis He That Bids You,
Let The Dying Look And Live;
To All Weary, Thirsting Sinners,
Living Waters Will He Give;
And Though Once So Meek And Lowly,
Yet The Prince Of Heaven Was He;
And The Blind, Who Grope In Darkness,
Through The Blood Of Christ Shall See.

Refrain
Lift Him Up, The Risen Savior,
High Amid The Waiting Throng;
Lift Him Up, 'Tis He That Speaketh,
Now He Bids You Flee From Wrong.

2
Lift Him Up, This Precious Savior,
Let The Multitude Behold;
They With Willing Hearts Shall Seek Him,
He Will Draw Them To His Fold;
They Shall Gather From The Wayside,
Hastening On With Joyous Feet,
They Shall Bear The Cross Of Jesus,
And Shall Find Salvation Sweet.

3
Lift Him Up In All His Glory,
'Tis The Son Of God On High;
Lift Him Up, His Love Shall Draw Them,
EÃ©N The Careless Shall Draw Nigh;
Let Them Hear Again The Story
Of The Cross, The Death Of Shame;
And From Tongue To Tongue Repeat It;
Mighty Throngs Shall Bless His Name.

4
O Then Lift Him Up In Singing,
Lift The Savior Up In Prayer;
He, The Glorious Redeemer,
All The Sins Of Men Did Bear;
Yes, The Young Shall Bow Before Him,
And The Old Their Voices Raise;
All The Deaf Shall Hear Hosannah;
And The Dumb Shall Shout His Praise.
