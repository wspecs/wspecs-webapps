248 - O, How I Love Jesus


1
There Is A Name I Love To Hear,
I Love To Sing Its Worth;
It Sounds Like Music In My Ears,
The Sweetest Name On Earth.

Refrain
O How I Love Jesus,
O How I Love Jesus,
O How I Love Jesus,
Because He First Loved Me.

2
It Tells Me Of A Savior'S Love,
Who Died To Set Me Free;
It Tells Me Of A Savior'S Blood,
The Sinners' Perfect Plea.

3
It Tells Of One Whose Loving Heart
Can Feel My Deepest Woe;
Who In Each Sorrow Bears
A Part That None Can Bear Below.
