036 - O Thou In Whose Presence


1
O Thou In Whose Presence My Soul Takes Delight,
On Whom In Affliction I Call,
My Comfort By Day And My Song In The Night,
My Hope, My Salvation, My All!

2
His Voice, As The Sound Of The Dulcimer Sweet,
Is Heard Through The Shadows Of Death;
The Cedars Of Lebanon Bow At His Feet,
The Air Is Perfumed With His Breath.

3
His Lips, As A Fountain Of Righteousness Flow,
To Water The Gardens Of Grace;
From Which Their Salvation The Gentiles Shall Know,
And Bask In The Smiles Of His Face.

4
He Looks, And Ten Thousands Of Angels Rejoice,
And Myriads Wait For His Word;
He Speaks, And Eternity, Filled With His Voice,
Re-Echoes The Praise Of The Lord.
