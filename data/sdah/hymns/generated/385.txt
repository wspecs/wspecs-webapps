385 - Crowning Jewel Of Creation


1
Crowning Jewel Of Creation,
Blest And Hallowed, Sanctified;
Time And Changes All Transcending,
Shared Forever, Glorified.

Refrain
Blessed Sabbath Made For Man,
Gift From The Creator'S Hand.

2
Sin And Sickness, Prayer And Weeping
Cease At Close Of Earthly Days;
But Thy Sabbath Is Eternal,
Joyful Thanks To Thee We Raise!

3
Teach Us Lord, In Storm Or Sunshine
How To Truly Rest In Thee,
May Thy Sabbath Peace Enfold Us
And Our Shelter Ever Be.
