655 - Happy The Home


1
Happy The Home When God Is There,
And Love Fills Every Breast;
When One Their Wish, And One Their Prayer,
And One Their Heavenly Rest.

2
Happy The Home Where Jesus' Name
Is Sweet To Every Ear;
Where Children Early Speak His Fame,
And Parents Hold Him Dear.

3
Happy The Home Where Prayer Is Heard,
And Praise Is Wont To Rise;
Where Parents Love The Sacred Word
And All Its Wisdom Prize.

4
Lord, Let Us In Our Homes Agree
This Blessed Peace To Gain;
Unite Our Hearts In Love To Thee,
And Love To All Will Reign.
