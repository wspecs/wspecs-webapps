021 - Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise


1
Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise,
In Light Inaccessible Hid From Our Eyes,
Most Blessed, Most Glorious, The Ancient Of Days,
Almighty, Victorious, Thy Great Name We Praise.

2
Unresting, Unhasting, And Silent As Light,
Nor Wanting, Nor Wasting, Thou Rulest In Might;
Thy Justice, Like Mountains, High Soaring Above
Thy Clouds, Which Are Fountains Of Goodness And Love.

3
To All, Life Thou Givest, To Both Great And Small;
In All Life Thou Livest, The True Life Of All;
We Blossom And Flourish As Leaves On The Tree,
And Wither And Perish - But Naught Changeth Thee.

4
Great Father Of Glory, Pure Father Of Light,
Thine Angels Adore Thee, All Veiling Their Sight;
All Praise We Would Render; O Help Us To See
'Tis Only The Splendor Of Light Hideth Thee!
