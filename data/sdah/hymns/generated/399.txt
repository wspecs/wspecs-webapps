399 - Beneath The Forms Of Outward Rite


1
Beneath The Forms Of Outward Rite
Thy Supper, Lord, Is Spread
In Every Quiet Upper Room
Where Fainting Souls Are Fed.

2
The Bread Is Always Consecrate
Which Men Divide With Men;
And Every Act Of Brotherhood
Repeats Thy Feast Again.

3
The Blessed Cup Is Only Passed
True Memory Of Thee,
When Life Anew Pours Out Its Wine
With Rich Sufficiency.

4
O Master, Through These Symbols Shared,
Thine Own Dear Self Impart,
That In Our Daily Life May Flame
The Passion Of Thy Heart.
