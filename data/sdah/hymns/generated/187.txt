187 - Jesus, What A Friend For Sinners


1
Jesus! What A Friend For Sinners!
Jesus! Lover Of My Soul;
Friends May Fail Me, Foes Assail Me,
He, My Savior, Makes Me Whole.

Refrain
Hallelujah! What A Savior!
Hallelujah! What A Friend!
Saving, Helping, Keeping, Loving,
He Is With Me To The End.

2
Jesus! What A Strength In Weakness!
Let Me Hide Myself In Him.
Tempted, Tried, And Sometimes Failing,
He, My Strength, My Victory Wins.

3
Jesus! What A Help In Sorrow!
While The Billows Over Me Roll,
Even When My Heart Is Breaking,
He, My Comfort, Helps My Soul.

4
Jesus! I Do Now Receive Him,
[Or Jesus! I Do Now Adore Him,]
More Than All In Him I Find.
He Hath Granted Me Forgiveness,
I Am His, And He Is Mine.
