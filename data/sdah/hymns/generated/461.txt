461 - Be Still, My Soul


1
Be Still, My Soul:
The Lord Is On Thy Side;
Bear Patiently The Cross Of Grief Or Pain;
Leave To Thy God To Order And Provide;
In Every Change He Faithful Will Remain.

Refrain
Be Still, My Soul:
Thy Best, Thy Heavenly Friend
Through Thorny Ways Leads To A Joyful End.

2
Be Still, My Soul:
Thy God Doth Undertake
To Guide The Future As He Has The Past.
Thy Hope, Thy Confidence Let Nothing Shake;
All Now Mysterious Shall Be Bright At Last.

3
Be Still, My Soul:
The Hour Is Hastening On
When We Shall Be Forever With The Lord,
When Disappointment, Grief, And Fear Are Gone,
Sorrow Forgot, Love'S Purest Joys Restored.
