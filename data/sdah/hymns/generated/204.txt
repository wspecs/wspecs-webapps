204 - Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus


1
Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus!
Born To Set Thy People Free;
From Our Fears And Sins Release Us,
Let Us Find Our Rest In Thee.
Israel'S Strength And Consolation,
Hope Of All The Earth Thou Art;
Dear Desire Of Every Nation,
Joy Of Every Longing Heart.

2
Born Thy People To Deliver,
Born A Child And Yet A King,
Born To Reign In Us Forever,
Now Thy Gracious Kingdom Bring.
By Thine Own Eternal Spirit
Rule In All Our Hearts Alone;
By Thine All Sufficient Merit,
Raise Us To Thy Glorious Throne.
