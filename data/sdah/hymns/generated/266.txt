266 - Spirit Of God


1
Spirit Of God, Descend Upon My Heart;
Wean It From Earth; Through All Its Pulses Move;
Stoop To My Weakness, Mighty As Thou Art,
And Make Me Love Thee As I Ought To Love.

2
I Ask No Dream, No Prophet Ecstasies,
No Sudden Rending Of The Veil Of Clay,
No Angel Visitant, No Opening Skies;
But Take The Dimness Of My Soul Away.

3
Has Thou Not Bid Me Love Thee, God And King?
All, All Thine Own, Soul, Heart And Strength And Mind.
I See Thy Cross; There Teach My Heart To Cling.
O Let Me Seek Thee, And O Let Me Find.

4
Teach Me To Feel That Thou Art Always Nigh;
Teach Me The Struggles Of The Soul To Bear.
To Check The Rising Doubt, The Rebel Sigh,
Teach Me The Patience Of Unanswered Prayer.

5
Teach Me To Love Thee As Thine Angels Love,
One Holy Passion Filling All My Frame;
The Kindling Of The Heaven-Descended Dove,
My Heart An Altar, And Thy Love The Flame.
