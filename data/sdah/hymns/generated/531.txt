531 - We'Ll Build On The Rock


1
We'Ll Build On The Rock, The Living Rock,
On Jesus, The Rock Of Ages;
So Shall We Abide The Fearful Shock,
When Loud The Tempest Rages.

Refrain
We'Ll Build On The Rock,
We'Ll Build On The Rock;
We'Ll Build On The Rock, On The Solid Rock,
On Christ, The Mighty Rock.

2
Some Build On The Sinking Sands Of Life,
On Visions Of Earthly Treasure;
Some Build On The Waves Of Sin And Strife,
Of Fame, And Worldly Pleasure.

3
O Build On The Rock, For Ever Sure,
The Firm And The True Foundation;
Its Hope Is The Hope Which Shall Endure,
The Hope Of Our Salvation.
