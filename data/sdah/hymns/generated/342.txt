342 - Is This A Day Of New Beginnings


1
Is This A Day Of New Beginnings,
Time To Remember And Move On,
Time Too Believe What Love Is Bringing,
Laying To Rest The Pain That'S Gone?

2
How Can The Seasons Of A Planet
Mindlessly Spinning Round Its Sun
With Just A Human Name And Number
Say That Some New Thing Has Begun?

3
Yet Through The Life And Death Of Jesus
Love'S Mighty Spirit, Now As Then,
Can Make For Us A World Of Difference
As Faith And Hope Are Born Again.

4
Then Let Us, With The Spirit'S Daring,
Step From The Past And Leave Behind
Its Disappointment, Guilt, And Grieving,
Seeking New Paths, And Sure To Find.

5
Christ Is Alive, And Goes Before Us
To Show And Share What Love Can Do.
This Is A Day Of New Beginnings;
Our God Is Making All Things New.
