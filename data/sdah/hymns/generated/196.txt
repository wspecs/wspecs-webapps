196 - Tell Me The Old, Old Story


1
Tell Me The Old, Old Story Of Unseen Things Above,
Of Jesus And His Glory, Of Jesus And His Love.
Tell Me The Story Simply, As To A Little Child,
For I Am Weak And Weary, And Helpless And Defiled.

Refrain
Tell Me The Old, Old Story, Tell Me The Old, Old Story,
Tell Me The Old, Old Story, Of Jesus And His Love.

2
Tell Me The Story Softly, With Earnest Tones And Grave;
Remember I'M The Sinner Whom Jesus Came To Save.
Tell Me The Story Always, If You Would Really Be,
In Any Time Of Trouble, A Comforter To Me.

3
Tell Me The Same Old Story When You Have Cause To Fear
That This World'S Empty Glory Is Costing Me Too Dear.
Yes, And When That World'S Glory Is Dawning On My Soul,
Tell Me The Old, Old Story: "Christ Jesus Makes Thee Whole."
