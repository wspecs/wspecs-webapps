227 - Jesus Shall Reign


1
Jesus Shall Reign Where'Er The Sun
Does His Successive Journeys Run;
His Kingdom Stretch From Shore To Shore,
Till Moons Shall Wax And Wane No More.

2
People And Realms Of Ev'Ry Tongue
Dwell On His Love With Sweetest Song,
And Infant Voices Shall Proclaim
Their Early Blessings On His Name.

3
Blessings Abound Wherever He Reigns;
The Prisoner Leaps To Lose His Chains;
The Weary Find Eternal Rest,
And All Who Suffer Want Are Blessed.

4
Let Every Creature Rise And Bring
Honors Peculiar To Our King;
Angels Descend With Songs Again,
And Earth Repeat The Loud Amen!
