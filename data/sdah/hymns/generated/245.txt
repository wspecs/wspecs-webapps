245 - More About Jesus


1
More About Jesus, I Would Know,
More Of His Grace To Others Show;
More Of His Saving Fullness See,
More Of His Love Who Died For Me.

Refrain
More, More About Jesus,
More, More About Jesus;
More Of His Saving Fullness See,
More Of His Love Who Died For Me.

2
More About Jesus, Let Me Learn,
More Of His Holy Will Discern;
Spirit Of God, My Teacher Be,
Showing The Things Of Christ To Me.

3
More About Jesus, In His Word,
Holding Communion With My Lord;
Hearing His Voice In Every Line,
Making Each Faithful Saying Mine.

4
More About Jesus, On His Throne,
Riches In Glory All His Own;
More Of His Kingdom'S Sure Increase,
More Of His Coming, Prince Of Peace.
