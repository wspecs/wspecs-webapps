464 - When I Can Read My Title Clear


1
When I Can Read My Title Clear
To Mansions In The Skies
I'Ll Bid Farewell To Every Fear,
And Wipe My Weeping Eyes;
And Wipe My Weeping Eyes,
And Wipe My Weeping Eyes,
I'Ll Bid Farewell To Every Fear,
And Wipe My Weeping Eyes.

2
Should Earth Against My Soul Engage,
And Fiery Darts Be Hurled,
Then I Can Smile At Satan'S Rage,
And Face A Frowning World;
And Face A Frowning World,
And Face A Frowning World,
Then I Can Smile At Satan'S Rage,
And Face A Frowning World.
