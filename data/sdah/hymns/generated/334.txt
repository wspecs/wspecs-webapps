334 - Come, Thou Fount Of Every Blessing


1
Come, Thou Fount Of Every Blessing,
Tune My Heart To Sing Thy Grace;
Streams Of Mercy, Never Ceasing,
Call For Songs Of Loudest Praise.
Teach Me Ever To Adore Thee,
May I Still Thy Goodness Prove,
While The Hope Of Endless Glory
Fills My Heart With Joy And Love.

2
Here I Raise Mine Ebenezer;
Hither By Thy Help I'Ve Come;
And I Hope, By Thy Good Pleasure,
Safely To Arrive At Home.
Jesus Sought Me When A Stranger,
Wandering From The Fold Of God;
He, To Rescue Me From Danger,
Interposed His Precious Blood.

3
O, To Grace How Great A Debtor
Daily I'M Constrained To Be!
Let Thy Goodness, Like A Fetter,
Bind Me Closer Still To Thee.
Prone To Wander, Lord, I Feel It,
Prone To Leave The God I Love;
Here'S My Heart-O, Take And Seal It,
Seal It For Thy Courts Above.
