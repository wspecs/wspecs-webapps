145 - Songs Of Thankfulness And Praise


1
Songs Of Thankfulness And Praise,
Jesus, Lord, To You We Raise,
Manifested By The Star
To The Sages From Afar;
Branch Of Royal David'S Stem
In Your Birth At Bethlehem;
Anthems Be To You Addressed,
God In Man Made Manifest.

2
Manifest At Jordan'S Stream,
Prophet, Priest, And King Supreme;
And At Cana, Wedding Guest,
In Your Godhead Manifest;
Manifest In Power Divine,
Changing Water Into Wine;
Anthems Be To You Addressed,
God In Man Made Manifest.

3
Manifest In Making Whole
Palsied Limbs And Fainting Soul;
Manifest In Valiant Fight,
Quelling All The Devil'S Might;
Manifest In Gracious Will,
Ever Bringing Good From Ill;
Anthems Be To You Addressed,
God In Man Made Manifest.

4
Grant Us Grace To See You, Lord,
Mirrored In Your Holy Word;
May We Imitate Your Way,
And Be Pure, As Pure As We May,
That We Like You May Be
At Your Great Epiphany;
Let Us Praise You, Ever Blest,
God In Man Made Manifest.
