041 - O Splendor Of God'S Glory Bright


1
O Splendor Of God'S Glory Bright,
From Light Eternal Bringing Light;
O Light Of Life, Light'S Living Spring,
True Day, All Days Illumining.

2
O Thou True Sun, On Us Thy Glance
Let Fall In Royal Radiance;
The Spirit'S Sanctifying Beam
Upon Our Earthly Senses Stream.

3
O Joyful Be The Passing Day
With Thoughts As Clear As Morning'S Ray,
With Faith Like Noontide Shining Bright,
Our Souls Unshadowed By The Night.

4
Dawn'S Glory Gilds The Earth And Skies;
Let Him, Our Perfect Morn, Arise;
The Father'S Help His Children Claim,
And Sing The Father'S Glorious Name. Amen.
