515 - The Lord Is My Light


1
The Lord Is My Light; Then Why Should I Fear?
By Day And By Night His Presence Is Near;
He Is My Salvation From Sorrow And Sin;
This Blessed Persuasion The Spirit Brings In.

Refrain
The Lord Is My Light, My Joy, And My Song;
By Day And By Night He Leads Me Along;
The Lord Is My Light, My Joy, And My Song;
By Day And By Night He Leads Me Along.

2
The Lord Is My Light; Though Clods May Arise,
Faith, Stronger Than Sight, Looks Up To The Skies
Where Jesus Forever In Glory Doth Reign:
Then How Can I Ever In Darkness Remain?

3
The Lord Is My Light, The Lord Is My Strength;
I Know In His Might I'Ll Conquer At Length;
My Weakness In Mercy He Covers With Power,
And, Walking By Faith, He Upholds Me Each Hour.

4
The Lord Is My Light, My All And In All;
There Is In His Sight No Darkness At All;
He Is My Redeemer, My Savior And King;
With Saints And With Angels His Praises I Sing.
