307 - I Am Coming To The Cross


1
I Am Coming To The Cross;
I Am Poor And Weak And Blind;
I Am Counting All But Dross;
I Shall Full Salvation Find.

Refrain
I Am Trusting, Lord, In Thee.
O Thou Lamb Of Calvary;
Humbly At Thy Cross I Bow.
Save Me, Jesus, Save Me Now.

2
Long My Heart Has Sighed For Thee;
Long Has Evil Reigned Within;
Jesus Sweetly Speaks To Me:
"I Will Cleanse You From All Sin."

3
Here I Give My All To Thee:
Friends And Time And Earthly Store;
Soul And Body Thine To Be,
Wholly Thine Forevermore.

4
Jesus Comes! He Fills My Soul!
Perfected In Him I Am;
I Am Every Whit Made Whole:
Glory, Glory To The Lamb!
