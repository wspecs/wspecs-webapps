247 - Come, My Way


1
Come, My Way, My Truth, My Life:
Such A Way As Gives Us Breath,
Such A Truth As Ends All Strife,
Such A Life As Killeth Death.

2
Come, My Light, My Feast, My Strength:
Such A Light As Shows A Feast,
Such A Feast As Mends In Length,
Such A Strength As Makes His Guest.

3
Come, My Joy, My Love, My Heart:
Such A Joy As None Can Move,
Such A Love As None Can Part,
Such A Heart As Joys In Love.
