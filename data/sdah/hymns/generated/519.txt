519 - Give To The Winds Your Fears


1
Give To The Winds Your Fears;
In Hope Be Undismayed:
God Hears Your Sighs And Coundts Your Tears,
God Shall Lift Up Your Head.

2
To Him Commit Your Griefs;
Your Ways Put In His Hands
To His Sure Truth Adn Tender Care
Who Earth Adn Heave Commands.

3
O Put Your Trust In God;
In Duty'S Path Go On.
Walk In His Strength With Faith And Hope,
So Shall Your Work Be Done.

4
Leave To His Sovereign Sway
To Choose And To Command;
So You Shall, Faithful, Seek His Way
How Wise, How Strong His Hand!
