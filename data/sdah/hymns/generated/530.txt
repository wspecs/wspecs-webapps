530 - It Is Well With My Soul


1
When Peace, Like A River, Attendeth My Way,
When Sorrows Like Sea Billows Roll;
Whatever My Lot, Thou Hast Taught Me To Say,
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.

Refrain
It Is Well With My Soul,
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.

2
My Sin-Oh, The Joy Of This Glorious Thought-
My Sin, Not In Part But The Whole,
Is Nailed To The Cross, And I Bear It No More,
Praise The Lord, Praise The Lord, O My Soul!

3
And, Lord, Haste The Day When My Faith Shall Be Sight,
The Clouds Be Rolled Back As A Scroll;
The Trump Shall Resound, And The Lord Shall Descend,
Even So, It Is Well With My Soul.
