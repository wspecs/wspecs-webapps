139 - While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks


1
While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night,
All Seated On The Ground,
The Angel Of The Lord Came Down,
And Glory Shone Around.

2
"Fear Nor!" Said He- For Mighty Dread
Had Seized Their Troubled Mind-
"Glad Tidings Of Great Joy I Bring,
To You And All Mankind.

3
"To You, In David'S Town This Day,
Is Born Of David'S Line,
The Savior Who Is Christ The Lord;
And This Shall Be The Sign:

4
"The Heavenly Babe You There Shall Find
To Human View Displayed,
All Meanly Wrapped In Swathing Bands,
And In A Manger Laid."

5
Thus Spake The Seraph; And Forth With
Appeared A Shining Throng
Of Angels Praising God On High,
Who Thus Addressed Their Song:

6
"All Glory Be To God On High,
And To The Earth Be Peace;
Good Will Henceforth From Heaven To Men,
Begin And Never Cease!"
