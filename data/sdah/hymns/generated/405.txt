405 - O God, Unseen, Yet Ever Near


1
O God, Unseen, Yet Ever Near,
Reveal Thy Presence Now
While We In Love That Hath No Fear,
Before Thy Glory Bow.

2
Here May Thy Faithful People Know
The Blessings Of Thy Love,
The Streams That Thro' The Dessert Flow,
The Manna From Above.

3
We Come, Obedient To Thy Word
To Feast On Heav'Nly Food,
Our Meat, The Body Of Our Lord,
Our Drink, His Precious Blood.

4
Thus May We All Thy Words Obey,
For We, O God, Are Thine,
