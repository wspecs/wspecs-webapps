318 - Whiter Than Snow


1
Lord Jesus, I Long To Be Perfectly Whole;
I Want Thee Forever To Live In My Soul;
Break Down Every Idol, Cast Out Every Foe;
Now Wash Me, And I Shall Be Whiter Than Snow.

Refrain
Whiter Than Snow, Yes, Whiter Than Snow;
Now Wash Me, And I Shall Be Whiter Than Snow.

2
Lord Jesus, Look Down From Thy Throne In The Skies,
And Help Me To Make A Complete Sacrifice;
I Give Up Myself, And Whatever I Know;
Now Wash Me, And I Shall Be Whiter Than Snow.

3
Lord Jesus, For This I Most Humbly Entreat;
I Wait, Blessed Lord, At Thy Crucified Feet,
By Faith, For My Cleansing; I See Thy Blood Flow;
Now Wash Me, And I Shall Be Whiter Than Snow.

4
Lord Jesus, Thou Seest I Patiently Wait;
Come Now, And Within Me A New Heart Create;
To Those Who Have Sought Thee,
Thou Never Said'St No;
Now Wash Me, And I Shall Be Whiter Than Snow.
