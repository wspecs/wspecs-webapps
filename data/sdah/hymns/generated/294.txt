294 - Power In The Blood


1
Would You Be Free From The Burden Of Sin?
There'S Pow'R In The Blood, Pow'R In The Blood;
Would You O'Er Evil A Victory Win?
There'S Wonderful Power In The Blood.

Refrain
There Is Pow'R, Pow'R, Wonder Working Pow'R
In The Blood Of The Lamb;
There Is Pow'R, Pow'R, Wonder Working Pow'R
In The Precious Blood Of The Lamb.

Would Be Free From Your Passion And Pride?
There'S Pow'R In The Blood, Pow'R In The Blood;
Come For A Cleansing To Calvary'S Tide?
There'S Wonderful Power In The Blood.

Would You Do Service For Jesus Your King?
There'S Pow'R In The Blood, Pow'R In The Blood;
Would You Live Daily His Praises To Sing?
There'S Wonderful Power In The Blood.
