457 - I Love To Tell The Story


1
I Love To Tell The Story
Of Unseen Things Above,
Of Jesus And His Glory,
Of Jesus And His Love.
I Love To Tell The Story,
Because I Know 'Tis True;
It Satisfies My Longings
As Nothing Else Can Do.

Refrain
I Love To Tell The Story,
'Twill Be My Theme In Glory,
To Tell The Old, Old Story
Of Jesus And His Love.

2
I Love To Tell The Story;
More Wonderful It Seems
Than All The Golden Fancies
Of All Our Golden Dreams.
I Love To Tell The Story,
It Did So Much For Me;
And That Is Just The Reason
I Tell It Now To Thee.

3
I Love To Tell The Story;
'Tis Pleasant To Repeat
What Seems, Each Time I Tell It,
More Wonderfully Sweet.
I Love To Tell The Story,
For Some Have Never Heard
The Message Of Salvation
From God'S Own Holy Word.

4
I Love To Tell The Story,
For Those Who Know It Best
Seem Hungering And Thirsting
To Hear It Like The Rest.
And When, In Scenes Of Glory,
I Sing The New, New Song,
'Twill Be The Old, Old Story
That I Have Loved So Long.
