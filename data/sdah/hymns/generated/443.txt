443 - There'Ll Be No Sorrow There


1
There'Ll Be No Night In Heaven,
In That Blest World Above;
No Anxious Toil, No Weary Hours;
For Labor There Is Love.

Refrain
There'Ll Be No Sorrow There,
There'Ll Be No Sorrow There;
In Heaven Above, Where All Is Love,
There'Ll Be No Sorrow There.

2
There'Ll Be No Grief In Heaven;
For Life Is One Glad Day,
And Tears Are Those Of Former Things
Which All Have Passed Away.

3
There'Ll Be No Sin In Heaven;
Behold That Blessed Throng,
All Holy In There Spotless Robes,
All Holy In Their Song.
