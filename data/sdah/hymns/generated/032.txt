032 - When In Our Music God Is Glorified


1
When In Our Music God Is Glorified,
And Adoration Leaves No Room For Pride,
It Is As Though The Whole Creation Cried:
Alleluia!

2
How Oft, In Making Music, We Have Found
A New Dimension In The World Of Sound,
As Worship Moved Us To A More Profound
Alleluia!

3
And Did Not Jesus Sing A Psalm That Night
When Utmost Evil Strove Against The Light?
Then Let Us Sing For Whom He Won The Fight:
Alleluia!

4
Let Every Instrument Be Used For Praise;
Let All Rejoice Who Have A Voice To Raise;
And May God Give Us Faith To Sing Always:
Alleluia!
