605 - My Soul, Be On Thy Guard


1
My Soul, Be On They Guard!
Ten Thousand Foes Arise;
The Hosts Of Sin Are Pressing Hard
To Draw Thee From The Skies.

2
O Watch, And Fight, And Pray!
The Battle Ne'Er Give O'Er;
Renew It Boldly Every Day,
And Help Divine Implore.

3
Ne'Er Think The Victory Won,
Nor Lay Thine Armor Down;
Thy Arduous Task Will Not Be Done
Till Thou Obtain The Crown.
