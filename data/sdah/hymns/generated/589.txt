589 - Holy Spirit, Gracious Guest


1
Holy Spirit, Gracious Guest,
Hear And Grant Our Heart'S Request
For That Gift Supreme And Best:
Holy Heav'Nly Love.

2
Faith That Mountains Could Remove,
Tongues Of Earth Or Heaven Above,
Knowledge, All Things, Empty Prove
If I Have No Love.

3
Though I As A Martyr Bleed,
Give My Goods The Poor To Feed,
All Is Vain If Love I Need:
Therefore Give Me Love.

4
Love Is Kind And Suffers Long,
Love Is Pure And Thinks No Wrong,
Love Than Death It Self More Strong:
Therefore Give Us Love.

5
Prophecy Will Fade Away,
Melting In The Light Of Day;
Love Will Ever With Us Stay:
Therefore Give Us Love.

6
Faith And Hope And Love We See
Joining Hand In Hand Agree-
But The Greatest Of The Three,
And The Best Is Love.
