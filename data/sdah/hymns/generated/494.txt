494 - We Would See Jesus


1
"We Would See Jesus;" For The Shadows Lengthen
Across The Little Landscape Of Our Life;
We Would See Jesus, Our Weak Faith To Strengthen
For The Last Conflict, In This Mortal Strife.

2
"We Would See Jesus," Rock Of Our Salvation,
Where On Our Feet Were Set With Sovereign Grace;
Not Life, Nor Death, With All Their Agitation,
Can Thence Remove Us, Gazing On His Face.

3
"We Would See Jesus;" Other Lights Are Paling,
Which For Long Years We Did Rejoice To See;
The Blessings Of This Sinful World Are Failing;
We Would Not Mourn Them, In Exchange For Thee.

4
"We Would See Jesus;" This Is All We'Re Needing-
Strength, Joy And Willingness Come With The Sight;
We Would See Jesus, Dying, Risen, Pleading,
Soon To Return And End This Mortal Night!
