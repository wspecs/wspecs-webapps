532 - Day By Day


1
Day By Day, And With Each Passing Moment,
Strength I Find, To Meet My Trials Here;
Trusting In My Father'S Wise Bestowment,
I'Ve No Cause For Worry Or For Fear.
He Whose Heart Is Kind Beyond All Measure
Gives Unto Each Day What He Deems Best-
Lovingly, Its Part Of Pain And Pleasure,
Mingling Toil With Peace And Rest.

2
Every Day, The Lord Himself Is Near Me
With A Special Mercy For Each Hour;
All My Cares He Fain Would Bear, And Cheer Me,
He Whose Name Is Counselor And Power;
The Protection Of His Child And Treasure
Is A Charge That On Himself He Laid;
"As Thy Days, Thy Strength Shall Be In Measure,"
This The Pledge To Me He Made.

3
Help Me Then In Every Tribulation
So To Trust Thy Promises, O Lord,
That I Lose Not Faith'S Sweet Consolation
Offered Me Within Thy Holy Word.
Help Me, Lord, When Toil And Trouble Meeting,
Ever To Take, As From A Father'S Hand,
One By One, The Days, The Moments Fleeting,
Till I Reach The Promised Land.
