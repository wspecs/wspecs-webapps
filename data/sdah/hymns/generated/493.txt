493 - Fill My Cup, Lord


1
Like The Woman At The Well I Was Seeking
For Things That Could Not Satisfy:
And Then I Heard My Savior Speaking:
" Draw From My Well That Never Shall Run Dry".

Refrain
Fill My Cup Lord, I Lift It Up, Lord!
Come And Quench This Thirsting Of My Soul;
Bread Of Heaven, Feed Me Till I Want No More-
Fill My Cup, Fill It Up And Make Me Whole!

2
There Are Millions In This World Who Are Craving
The Pleasures Earthly Things Afford;
But None Can Match The Wondrous Treasure
That I Find In Jesus Christ My Lord.

3
So, My Brother, If The Things This World Gave You
Leave Hungers That Won'T Pass Away,
My Blessed Lord Will Come And Save You,
If You Kneel To Him And Humbly Pray:
