287 - Softly And Tenderly


1
Softly And Tenderly Jesus Is Calling,
Calling For You And For Me;
See, On The Portals He'S Waiting And Watching,
Watching For You And For Me.

Refrain
Come Home, Come Home;
Ye Who Are Weary Come Home;
Earnestly, Tenderly, Jesus Is Calling,
Calling, O Sinner, Come Home!

2
Why Should We Tary When Jesus Is Pleading,
Pleading For You And For Me?
Why Should We Linger And Heed Not His Mercies,
Mercies For You And For Me?

3
Think Of The Wonderful Love He Has Promised,
Promised For You And For Me!
Though We Have Sinned, He Has Mercy And Pardon,
Pardon For You And For Me.
