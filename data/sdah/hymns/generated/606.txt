606 - Once To Every Man And Nation


1
Once To Every Man And Nation,
Comes The Moment To Decide,
In The Strife Of Truth With Falsehood,
For The Good Or Evil Side;
Some Great Cause, Some Great Decision,
Offering Each The Bloom Or Blight,
And The Choice Goes By Forever,
'Twixt That Darkness And That Light.

2
Then To Side With Truth Is Noble,
When We Share Her Wretched Crust,
Ere Her Cause Bring Fame And Profit,
And 'Tis Prosperous To Be Just;
Then It Is The Brave Man Chooses
While The Coward Stands Aside,
Till The Multitude Make Virtue
Of The Faith They Had Denied.

3
By The Light Of Burning Martyrs, Christ,
Thy Bleeding Feet We Track,
Toiling Up New Calv'Ries Ever
With The Cross That Turns Not Back;
New Occasions Teach New Duties,
Time Makes Ancient Good Uncouth,
They Must Upward Still And Onward,
Who Would Keep Abreast Of Truth.

4
Though The Cause Of Evil Prosper,
Yet The Truth Alone Is Strong;
Though Her Portion Be The Scaffold,
And Upon The Throne Be Wrong;
Yet That Scaffold Sways The Future,
And Behind The Dim Unknown,
Standeth God Within The Shadow,
Keeping Watch Above His Own.
