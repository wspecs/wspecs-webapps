426 - I Shall See The King


1
I Shall See The King Where The Angels Sing,
I Shall See The King Some Day, In The Better Land,
On That Golden Strand,
And With Him Shall Ever Stay.

Refrain
In His Glory, I Shall See The King,
And Forever Endless Praises Sing;
'Twas On Calvary Jesus Died For Me;
I Shall See The King Someday.

2
In The Land Of Song, In The Glory Throng,
Where There Never Comes A Night,
With My Lord Once Slain I Shall Ever Reign
In The Glory Land Of Light.

3
I Shall See The King, All My Tributes Bring,
And Shall Look Upon His Face;
Then My Song Shall Be How He Ransomed Me
And Has Kept Me By His Grace.
