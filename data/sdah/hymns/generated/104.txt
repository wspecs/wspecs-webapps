104 - My Shepherd Will Supply My Need


1
My Shepherd Will Supply My Need,
Jehovah Is His Name.
In Pastures Fresh He Makes Me Feed
Beside The Living Stream.
He Brings My Wand'Ring Spirit Back
When I Forsake His Ways,
And Leads, Me For His Mercy'S Sake,
In Paths Of Truth And Grace.

2
When I Walk Through The Shades Of Death,
Thy Presence Is My Stay;
A Word Of Thy Supporting Breath
Drives All My Fears Away.
Thy Hand In Sight Of All My Foes
Doth Still My Table Spread;
My Cup With Blessings Overflows,
Thine Oil Anoints My Head.

3
The Sure Provisions Of My God
Attend Me All My Days;
O May Thy House Be Mine Abode
And All My Work Be Praise.
There Would I Find A Settled Rest
While Others Go And Come;
No More A Stranger Or A Guest,
But Like A Child At Home.
