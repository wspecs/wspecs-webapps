609 - Am I A Soldier Of The Cross


1
Am I A Soldier Of The Cross,
A Follower Of The Lamb,
And Shall I Fear To Own His Cause,
Or Blush To Speak His Name?

2
Must I Be Carried To The Skies
On Flowery Beds Of Ease,
While Others Fought To Win The Prize,
And Sailed Through Bloody Seas?

3
Are There No Foes For Me To Face?
Must I Not Stem The Flood?
Is This Vile World A Friend To Grace,
To Help Me On To God?

4
Sure I Must Fight, If I Would Reign;
Increase My Courage, Lord
I'Ll Bear The Toil, Endure The Pain,
Supported By Thy Word

5
Thy Saints In All This Glorious War
Shall Conquer Though They Die;
They See The Triumph From Afar,
By Faith They Bring It Nigh

6
When That Illustrious Day Shall Rise,
And All Thy Armies Shine
In Robes Of Victory Through The Skies,
The Glory Shall Be Thine
