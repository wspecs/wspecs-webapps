126 - In The Bleak Midwinter


1
In The Bleak Midwinter
Frosty Wind Made Moan;
Earth Stood Hard As Iron,
Water Like A Stone;
Snow Had Fallen, Snow On Snow,
Snow On Snow,
In The Bleak Midwinter,
Long Ago.

2
Angels And Archangels
May Have Gathered There,
Cherubim And Seraphim
Thronged The Air:
But His Mother Only
In Her Maiden Bliss,
Worshipped The Beloved
With A Kiss.

3
What Can I Give Him,
Poor As I Am?
If I Were A Shepherd
I Would Bring A Lamb;
If I Were A Wise Man
I Would Do My Part;
Yet What Can I Give Him?
Give My Heart.
