323 - O For A Heart To Praise My God!


1
O For A Heart To Praise My God,
A Heart From Sin Set Free,
A Heart That Always Feels Thy Blood
So Freely Shed For Me.

2
A Heart Resigned, Submissive, Meek,
My Dear Redeemer'S Throne,
Where Only Christ Is Heard To Speak,
Where Jesus Reigns Alone.

3
A Heart In Every Thought Renewed
And Full Of Love Divine,
Perfect And Right And Pure And Good,
A Copy, Lord, Of Thine.

4
Thy Nature, Gracious Lord, Impart;
Come Quickly From Above;
Write Thy New Name Upon My Heart,
Thy New, Best Name Of Love.
