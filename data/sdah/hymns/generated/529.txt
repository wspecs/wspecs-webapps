529 - Under His Wings


1
Under His Wings I Am Safely Abiding;
Though The Night Deepens And Tempests Are Wild,
Still I Can Trust Him; I Know He Will Keep Me;
He Has Redeemed Me, And I Am His Child.

Refrain
Under His Wings, Under His Wings,
Who From His Love Can Sever?
Under His Wings, My Soul Shall Abide,
Safely Abide Forever.

2
Under His Wings, What A Refuge In Sorrow!
How The Heart Yearningly Turns To Its Rest!
Often When Earth Has No Balm For My Healing,
There I Find Comfort, And There I Am Blest.

3
Under His Wings, O What Precious Enjoyment!
There Will I Hide Till Life'S Trials Are Over;
Sheltered, Protected, No Evil Can Harm Me;
Resting In Jesus I'M Safe Evermore.
