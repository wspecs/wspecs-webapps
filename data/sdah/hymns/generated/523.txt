523 - My Faith Has Found A Resting Place


1
My Faith Has Found A Resting Place,
Not In A Manmade Creed;
I Trust The Ever Living One,
That He For Me Shall Plead.

Refrain
I Need No Other Evidence,
I Need No Other Plea;
It Is Enough That Jesus Died,
And Rose Again For Me.

2
Enough For Me That Jesus Saves,
This Ends My Fear And Doubt;
A Sinful Soul, I Come To Him,
He Will Not Cast Me Out.

3
My Soul Is Resting On The Word,
The Living Word Of God,
Salvation In My Savior'S Name,
Salvation Through His Blood.

4
My Great Physician Heals The Sick,
The Lost He Came To Save;
For Me His Precious Blood He Shed,
For Me His Life He Gave.
