246 - Worthy, Worthy Is The Lamb


1
Worthy, Worthy Is The Lamb,
Worthy, Worthy Is The Lamb,
Worthy, Worthy Is The Lamb,
That Was Slain.

Refrain
Glory, Hallelujah!
Praise Him, Hallelujah!
Glory, Hallelujah!
To The Lamb!

2
Savior, Let Thy Kingdom Come!
Now The Power Of Sin Consume;
Bring Thy Blest Millennium,
Holy Lamb.

3
Thus May We
Each Moment Feel,
Love Him, Serve Him,
Praise Him Still,
Till We All On Zion'S Hill
See The Lamb.
