465 - I Heard The Voice Of Jesus


1
I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say,
"Come Unto Me And Rest;
Lay Down, Thou Weary One, Lay Down
Thy Head Upon My Breast."
I Came To Jesus As I Was,
Weary And Worn And Sad;
I Found In Him A Resting Place,
And He Has Made Me Glad.

2
I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say,
"Behold, I Freely Give
The Living Water; Thirsty One,
Stoop Down And Drink And Live."
I Came To Jesus, And I Drank
Of That Life Giving Stream;
My Thirst Was Quench'D, My Soul Revived,
And Now I Live In Him.

3
I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say,
"I Am This Dark World'S Light;
Look Unto Me, Thy Morn Shall Rise,
And All Thy Day Be Bright."
I Looked To Jesus, And I Found
In Him My Star, My Sun;
And In That Light Of Life I'Ll Walk,
Till Trav'Ling Days Are Done.
