358 - Far And Near The Fields Are Teeming


1
Far And Near The Fields Are Teeming
With The Sheaves Of Ripened Grain;
Far And Near Their Gold Is Gleaming
O'Er The Summy Slope And Plain.

Refrain
Lord Of Harvest, Send Forth Reapers!
Hear Us Lord,To Thee We Cry;
Send Them Now The Sheaves To Gather,
Ere The Harvest-Time Pass By.

2
Send Them Forth With Morn'S First Beaming,
Send Them In The Noon-Tides'S Glare;
When The Sun'S Last Rays Are Streaming,
Bid Them Gather Everywhere.

3
O Thou, Whom Thy Lord Is Sending,
Gather Now The Sheaves Of Gold;
Heavenward Then At Evening Wending
Thou Shalt Come With Joy Untold.
