016 - All People That On Earth Do Well


1
All People That On Earth Do Dwell,
Sing To The Lord With Cheerful Voice.
Him Serve With Mirth, His Praise Forth Tell;
Come Ye Before Him And Rejoice.

2
Know That The Lord Is God Indeed;
Without Our Aid He Did Us Make;
We Are His Folk, He Doth Us Feed,
And For His Sheep He Doth Us Take.

3
O Enter Then His Gates With Praise;
Approach With Joy His Courts Unto;
Praise, Laud, And Bless His Name Always,
For It Is Seemly So To Do.

4
For Why! The Lord Our God Is Good;
His Mercy Is Forever Sure;
His Truth At All Times Firmly Stood,
And Shall From Age To Age Endure.
