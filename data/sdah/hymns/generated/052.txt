052 - Now The Day Is Over


1
Now The Day Is Over,
Night Is Drawing Nigh,
Shadows Of The Evening
Steal Across The Sky.

2
Father, Give The Weary,
Calm And Sweet Repose;
With Thy Tenderest Blessing
May Our Eyelids Close.

3
Through The Long Night Watches,
May Thine Angels Spread
Their White Wings Above Me,
Watching Round My Bed.
