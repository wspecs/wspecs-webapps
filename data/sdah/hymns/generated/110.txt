110 - God'S Free Mercy Streameth


1
God'S Free Mercy Streameth Over All The World,
And His Banner Gleameth, By His Church Unfuried;
Broad And Deep And Glorious, As The Heaven Above,
Shines In Might Victorious His Eternal Love.

2
Summer Suns Are Glowing Over Land And Sea;
Happy Light Is Flowing, Bountiful And Free;
Everything Rejoices In The Mellow Rays;
Earth'S Ten Thousand Voices Swell The Psalm Of Praise.

3
Lord, Upon Our Blindness Thy Pure Radiance Pour;
For Thy Loving Kindness We Would Love Thee More;
And When Clouds Are Drifting Dark Across The Sky,
Then, The Veil Uplifting, Father, Be Thou Nigh.

4
We Will Never Doubt Thee, Tho' Veil Thy Light;
Life Is Dark Without Thee, Death With Thee Is Bright.
Light Of Light, Shine O'Er Us On Our Pilgrim Way,
Go Thou Still Before Us To The Endless Day.
