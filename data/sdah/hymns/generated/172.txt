172 - The Strife Is O'Er (Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!)

1
The Strife Is O'Er, The Battle Done;
Now Is The Victor'S Triumph Won!
Now Be The Song Of Praise Begun. Alleluia!

2
The Pow'Rs Of Death Have Done Their Worst,
But Christ Their Legions Has Dispersed.
Let Shouts Of Holy Joy Outburst. Alleluia!

3
The Three Sad Days Have Quickly Sped,
He Rises Glorious From The Dead.
All Glory To Our Risen Head! Alleluia!

4
Lord, By The Stripes Which Wounded You,
From Death'S Sting Free Your Servants Too,
That We May Live And Sing To You. Alleluia!
