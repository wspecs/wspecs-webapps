390 - We Love Thy Sabbath, Lord


1
We Love Thy Sabbath, Lord,
And Worship At Thy Will;
Oh May These Hours Sweet Peace Afford
And Deeper Faith Instill.

2
Thine Angels Sang For Joy
Cration'S Work To See;
We Too, This Day, Would Raise Our Hearts
In Grateful Praise To Thee.

3
Praise For Thy Wondrous Love,
That Sealed This Sacred Day,
A Sign That All May Understand
We Own Thy Sovereign Sway.

4
O Great Creator King,
Through Thy Redeeming Grace,
Renew And Sanctify Our Hearts
That We May See Thy Face.

5
And With The White-Robed Throng,
Upon Mount Sion Be,
And Joyful Sing Our Sabbath Song
Through All Eternity.
