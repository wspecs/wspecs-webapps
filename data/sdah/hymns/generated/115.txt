115 - O Come, O Come, Immanuel


1
O Come, O Come, Emmanuel,
And Ransom Captive Israel,
That Mourns In Lonely Exile Here
Until The Son Of God Appear.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel Shall Come To Thee,
O Israel.

2
O Come, Thou Wisdom From On High,
And Order All Things Far And Night;
To Us The Path Of Knowledge Show,
And Cause Us In Her Ways To Go.

3
O Come, Desire Of Nations, Bind
In One The Hearts Of All Mankind;
Bid Thou Our Sad Divisions Cease,
And Be Thyself Our King Of Peace.
