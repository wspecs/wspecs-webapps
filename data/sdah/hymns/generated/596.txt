596 - Look For The Waymarks


1
Look For The Way-Marks As You Journey On,
Look For The Way-Marks Passing One By One;
Down Through The Ages, Past The Kingdoms Four-
Where Are We Standing? Look The Way-Marks O'Er.

Refrain
Look For The Way-Marks, The Great Prophetic Way-Marks,
Down Through The Ages, Past The Kingdoms Four.
Look For The Waymarks, The Great Prophetic Way-Marks;
The Journey'S Almost O'Er.

First, The Assyrian Kingdom Ruled The World,
Then Medo-Persia'S Banners Were Unfurled;
And After Greece Held Universal Sway,
Rome Seized The Scepter-Where Are We Today?

3
Down In The Feet Of Iron And Of Clay,
Weak And Divided, Soon To Pass Away;
What Will The Next Great, Glorious Drama Be?
Christ And His Coming, And Eternity.
