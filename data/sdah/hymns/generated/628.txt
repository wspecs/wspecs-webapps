628 - As Jacob With Travel Was Weary


1
As Jacob With Travel Was Weary One Day,
At Night On A Stone For A Pillow He Lay;
He Saw In A Vision A Ladder So High
That Its Foot Was On Earth And Its Top In The Sky.

Refrain
Alleluia To Jesus Who Died On The Tree,
And Has Raised Up A Ladder Of Mercy For Me,
And Has Raised Up A Ladder Of Mercy For Me.

2
Come Let Us Ascend! All May Climb It Who Will;
For The Angels Of Jacob Are Guarding It Still:
And Remember Each Step That By Faith We Passo'Er,
Some Prophet Or Martyr Has Trod It Before.

3
And When We Arrive At The Haven Of Rest
We Shall Hear The Glad Words, "Come Up Hither, Ye Blest,
Here Are Regions Of Light, Here Are Mansions Of Bliss."
O Who Would Not Climb Such A Ladder As This?
