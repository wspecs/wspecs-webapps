147 - Christ Upon The Mountain Peak


1
Christ Upon The Mountain Peak
Stands Alone In Glory Blazing;
Let Us, If We Dare To Speak,
With The Saints And Angels Praise Him:

Refrain
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

2
Trembling At His Feet We Saw
Moses And Elijah Speaking;
All The Prophets And The Law
Shout Thro' Them Their Joyful Greeting:

Refrain
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

3
Swift The Cloud Of Glory Came,
God Proclaiming In The Thunder
Jesus As His Son By Name;
Nations Cry Aloud In Wonder!

Refrain
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

4
This Is God'S Beloved Son:
Law And Prophets Fade Before Him;
First And Last, The Only One,
Let Creation Now Adore Him.

Refrain
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
