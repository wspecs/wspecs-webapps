603 - Christian, Seek Not Repose


1
Christian, Seek Not Yet Repose,
Cast Thy Dreams Of Ease Away;
Thou Aret In Teh Midst Of Foes;
Watch And Pray!

2
Gird Thy Heavenly Armor On,
Wear It Ever, Night And Day;
Ambushed Lies The Evil One;
Watch And Pray!

3
Hear The Victors Who O'Ercame;
Still They Mark Each Warrior'S Way;
All With One Sweet Voice Exclaim:
"Watch And Pray!"

4
Hear, Above All, Hear Thy Lord,
Him Thou Lovest To Obey;
Hide Within Thy Heart His Word;
"Watch And Pray!"

5
Watch, As If On That Alone
Hung The Issue Of Teh Day;
Pray That Help May Be Send Down;
Watch And Pray!
