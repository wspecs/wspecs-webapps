328 - Must Jesus Bear The Cross Alone


1
Must Jesus Bear The Cross Alone,
And All The World Go Free?
No, There'S A Cross For Everyone,
And There'S A Cross For Me.

2
The Consecrated Cross I'Ll Bear
Till He Shall Set Me Free;
And Then Go Home My Crown To Wear,
For There'S A Crown For Me.

3
Upon The Crystal Pavement, Down
At Jesus' Pierced Feet,
With Joy I'Ll Cast My Golden Crown,
And His Dear Name Repeat.
