072 - Creator Of The Stars Of Night


1
Creator Of The Stars Of Night,
Thy People'S Everlasting Light,
O Christ, Thou Saviour Of Us All,
We Pray Thee, Hear Us When We Call.

2
At The Great Name Of Jesus, Now
All Knees Must Bend, All Hearts Must Bow;
And Things Celestial Thee Shall Own,
And Things Terrestrial, Lord Alone.

3
To God The Father, God The Son,
And God The Spirit, Three In One,
Laud, Honour, Might, And Glory Be
From Age To Age Eternally.
Amen.
