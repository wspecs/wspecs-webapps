117 - The Advent Of Our God


1
The Advent Of Our God
With Eager Prayers We Greet,
And Singing Haste Upon His Road
His Coming Reign To Meet.

2
The Everlasting Son
Was Born To Make Us Free;
And He A Servant'S Form Put On
To Gain Our Liberty.

3
As Judge, On Clouds Of Light,
He Soon Will Come Again,
His Scattered People To Unite
With Them In Heaven To Reign.

4
Praise To The Incarnate Son
Who Comes To Set Us Free,
With Father, Spirit, Ever One,
To All Eternity.
