1
In Imitation, Lord, Of Thee,
This Solemn Service We Repeat;
For Thine Example Full Of Grace,
Has Made This Humble Duty Sweet.

Renew Each Sacred Spark Of Love,
And Vitalize The Holy Flame;
May Union Strong Our Hearts Unite
While This We Do In Jesus' Name.

3
Our Great Example Thou Shalt Be,
In Washing Thy Disciples Feet;
And As We Follow Thy Command,
Make Thou Our Fellowship Complete.
