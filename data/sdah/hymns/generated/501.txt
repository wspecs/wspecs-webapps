501 - Tis The Blessed Hour Of Prayer


1
'Tis The Blessed Hour Of Prayer,
When Our Hearts Lowly Bend,
And We Gather To Jesus,
Our Savior And Friend;
If We Come To Him In Faith,
His Protection To Share,

Refrain
What A Balm For The Weary!
O How Sweet To Be There!
Blessed Hour Of Prayer,
Blessed Hour Of Prayer,
What A Balm For The Weary!
O How Sweet To Be There!

2
'Tis The Blessed Hour Of Prayer,
When The Savior Draws Near,
With A Tender Compassion
His Children To Hear;
When He Tells Us We May Cast
At His Feet Every Care,

3
'Tis The Blessed Hour Of Prayer,
When The Tempted And Tried
To The Savior Who Loves Them
Their Sorrows Confide;
With A Sympathizing Heart
He Removes Every Care;

4
'Tis The Blessed Hour Of Prayer,
Trusting Him We Believe,
That The Blessings We'Re Needing
We'Ll Surely Receive;
In The Fullness Of This Trust
We Shall Lose Every Care;
