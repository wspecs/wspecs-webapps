619 - Lead On, O King Eternal


1
Lead On, O King Eternal,
The Day Of March Has Come;
Henceforth In Fields Of Conquest
Thy Tents Shall Be Our Home.
Through Days Of Preparation
Thy Grace Has Made Us Strong;
And Now, O King Eternal,
We Lift Our Battle Song.

2
Lead On, O King Eternal,
Till Sin'S Fierce War Shall Cease,
And Holiness Shall Whisper
The Sweet Amen Of Peace.
For Not With Swords Loud Clashing,
Nor Roll Of Stirring Drums;
With Deeds Of Love And Mercy
The Heavenly Kingdom Comes.

3
Lead On, O King Eternal,
We Follow, Not With Fears,
For Gladness Breaks Like Morning
Where'Er Thy Face Appears.
Thy Cross Is Lifted O'Er Us,
We Journey In Its Light;
The Crown Awaits The Conquest;
Lead On, O God Of Might.
