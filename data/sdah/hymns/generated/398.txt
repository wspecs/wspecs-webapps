398 - Bread Of The World


1
Bread Of The World In Mercy Broken,
Wine Of The Soul In Mercy Shed,
By Whom The Words Of Life Are Spoken,
And In Whose Death Our Sins Are Dead;

2
Look On The Heart By Sorrow Broken,
Look On The Tears By Sinners Shed;
And Be Thy Feast To Us The Token
That By Thy Grace Our Souls Are Fed. Amen.
