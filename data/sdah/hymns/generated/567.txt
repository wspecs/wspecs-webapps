567 - Have Thine Own Way, Lord


1
Have Thine Own Way, Lord! Have Thine Own Way!
Thou Art The Potter, I Am The Clay.
Mold Me And Make Me After Thy Will,
While I Am Waiting, Yielded And Still.

2
Have Thine Own Way, Lord! Have Thine Own Way!
Search Me And Try Me, Savior Today!
Wash Me Just Now, Lord, Wash Me Just Now,
As In Thy Presence Humbly I Bow.

3
Have Thine Own Way, Lord! Have Thine Own Way!
Wounded And Weary, Help Me I Pray!
Power, All Power, Surely Is Thine!
Touch Me And Heal Me, Savior Divine!

4
Have Thine Own Way, Lord! Have Thine Own Way!
Hold O'Er My Being Absolute Sway.
Fill With Thy Spirit Till All Shall See
Christ Only, Always, Living In Me!
