063 - O Come, Let Us Sing To The Lord


1
O Come, Let Us Sing To The Lord,
Come Let Us Every One
A Joyful Noise Make To The Rock
Of Our Salvation.

2
Let Us Before His Presence Come
With Glad And Thankful Voice;
Let Us Sing Psalms Of Praise To Him,
And Make A Joyful Noise.

3
For God, A Great God And Great King,
Above All Gods, He Is;
The Depths Of Earth Are In His Hand,
The Strength Of Hills Is His.

4
To Him The Ocean Vast Belongs,
For He The Sea Did Make;
The Dry Land Also From His Hands,
Its Form At First Did Take.

5
O Come, Bow Down And Worship Him,
And Kneeling, Humbly Pray,
Come To Our Maker And Our God,
And Hear His Voice Today.
