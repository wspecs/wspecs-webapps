045 - Open Now Thy Gates Of Beauty


1
Open Now Thy Gates Of Beauty,
Zion, Let Me Enter There,
Where My Soul In Joyful Duty
Waits For God Who Answers Prayer.
Oh, How BlessÃ¨D Is This Place,
Filled With Solace, Light, And Grace!

2
Gracious God, I Come Before Thee,
Come Thou Also Unto Me;
Where We Find Thee And Adore Thee,
There A Heav'N On Earth Must Be.
To My Heart, Oh, Enter Thou,
Let It Be Thy Temple Now!

3
Here Thy Praise Is Gladly Chanted,
Here Thy Seed Is Duly Sown;
Let My Soul, Where It Is Planted,
Bring Forth Precious Sheaves Alone,
So That All I Hear May Be
Fruitful Unto Life In Me.

4
Thou My Faith Increase And Quicken,
Let Me Keep Thy Gift Divine,
Howsoe'Er Temptations Thicken;
May Thy Word Still O'Er Me Shine
As My Guiding Star Through Life,
As My Comfort In My Strife.

5
Speak, O God, And I Will Hear Thee,
Let Thy Will Be Done Indeed;
May I Undisturbed Draw Near Thee
While Thou Dost Thy People Feed.
Here Of Life The Fountain Flows;
Here Is Balm For All Our Woes.
