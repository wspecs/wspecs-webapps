027 - Rejoice Ye Pure In Heart!


1
Rejoice Ye Pure In Heart!
Rejoice, Give Thanks, And Sing;
Your Festal Banner Wave On High,
The Cross Of Christ Your King.

Refrain
Rejoice, Rejoice, Rejoice,
Give Thanks And Sing.

2
With Voice As Full And Strong
As Ocean'S Surging Praise,
Send Forth The Sturdy Hymns Of Old,
The Psalms Of Ancient Days.

3
With All The Angel Choirs,
With All The Saints Of Earth,
Pour Out The Strains Of Joy And Bliss,
True Rapture, Noblest Mirth.

4
Yes, On Through Life'S Long Path,
Still Chanting As Ye Go;
From Youth To Age, By Night And Day,
In Gladness And In Woe.

5
Praise Him Who Reigns On High,
The Lord Whom We Adore,
The Father, Son And Holy Ghost,
One God Forever More.
