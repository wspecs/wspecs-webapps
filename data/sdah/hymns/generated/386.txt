386 - The Sacred Anthem


1
The Sacred Anthem Slowly Rang
Across The Fields Of Praise,
When Earth'S First Sabbath Made Complete
All Creatures And All Days.

2
Walking With God, There,
Woman And Man Together Share
The Blessed Sabbath Mood;
And In That Green And Golden World
Know All God'S Works Are Good.

3
But Now In Our Diminished Lives
We Sing A Blemished Song;
The Earth Is Worn And Disarrayed
And All Our Work Goes Wrong.

4
Still In Our Worship,
Joining In Praise And Fellowship,
By Sabbath Radiance Blessed,
We Put Our Doubt And Fear Away
And Rest Within God'S Rest.

5
And Arching Over Time And Space
The Lord Of Sabbaths Wills
Renewal For The Weary Earth
And Healing For Our Ills.

6
Hearts Will Rejoice Then;
There Will Be No More Weeping, When
We Know And Shall Be Known.
With Hosts Of The Redeemed We'Ll Sing
Around God'S Shining Throne.
