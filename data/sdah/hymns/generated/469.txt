469 - Leaning On The Everlasting Arms


1
What A Fellowship, What A Joy Divine,
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms;
What A Blessedness, What A Peace Is Mine,
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.

Refrain
Leaning, Leaning,
Safe And Secure From All Alarms;
Leaning, Leaning,
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.

2
O How Sweet To Walk In This Pilgrim Way,
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms;
O How Bright The Path Grows From Day To Day,
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.

3
What Have I To Dread, What Have I To Fear,
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms?
I Have Blessed Peace With My Lord So Near,
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.
