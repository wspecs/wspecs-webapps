538 - Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah


1
Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah,
Pilgrim Through This Barren Land.
I Am Weak, But Thou Art Mighty;
Hold Me With Thy Powerful Hand.
Bread Of Heaven, Bread Of Heaven,
Feed Me Till I Want No More;
Feed Me Till I Want No More.

2
Open Now The Crystal Fountain,
Whence The Healing Stream Doth Flow;
Let The Fire And Cloudy Pillar
Lead Me All My Journey Through.
Strong Deliverer, Strong Deliverer,
Be Thou Still My Strength And Shield;
Be Thou Still My Strength And Shield.

3
When I Tread The Verge Of Jordan,
Bid My Anxious Fears Subside;
Death Of Death And Hell'S Destruction,
Land Me Safe On Canaan'S Side.
Songs Of Praises, Songs Of Praises,
I Will Ever Give To Thee;
I Will Ever Give To Thee.
