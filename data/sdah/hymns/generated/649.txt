649 - Lord, While For All Mankind We Pray


1
Lord, While For All Mankind We Pray
Of Every Clime And Coast,
O Hear Us For Our Native Land,
The Land We Love The Most!

2
O Guard Our Shores From Every Foe,
With Peace Our Borders Bless;
With Prosperous Times Our Cities Crown,
Our Fields With Plenteousness!

3
Unite Us In The Sacred Love
Of Knowledge, Truth, And Thee;
And Let Our Hills And Valleys Shout
The Songs Of Liberty.

4
Lord Of The Nations, Thus To Thee
Our Country We Commend;
Be Thou Her Refuge And Her Trust,
Her Everlasting Friend.
