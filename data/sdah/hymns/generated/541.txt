541 - Lord, Speak To Me


1
Lord, Speak To Me, That I May Speak
In Living Echoes Of Thy Tone;
As Thou Has Sought, So Let Me Seek
Thine Erring Children Lost And Lone.

2
O Lead Me, Lord, That I May Lead
The Wandering And The Wavering Feet;
O Feed Me, Lord, That I May Feed
Thy Hungering Ones With Manna Sweet.

3
O Strengthen Me, That While I Stand
Firm On The Rock, And Strong In Thee,
I May Stretch Out A Loving Land
To Wrestlers With The Troubled Sea.
