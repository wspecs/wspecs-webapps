059 - Great Our Joy As Now We Gather


1
Great Our Joy As Now We Gather
Where The Master Makes Us One:
Where We Worship God The Father
Thro' The Spirit Of His Son.
All Who Search For His Church
Find It Where His Will Is Done.

2
Precious Is The Tie That Binds Us
To Our God When Faith Grows Cold;
Precious All That Now Reminds Us
He Is Still Our Safe Stronghold.
Faithful Love Serves To Prove
Here The Shepherd Has His Fold.

3
May We Learn From Christ'S Example
How To Use This House Of Prayer:
He Who Loved And Cleansed His Temple
Wants Us All To Worship There.
God The Son Shuts Out None:
In His Kingdom All May Share.

4
Lord, Inspire Us With Your Vision
Of A World Which Must Be Won!
Glorious Is The Church'S Mission,
Long Endeavoured, Scarce Begun!
Faithful Now - This Is How
God'S Eternal Will Is Done.
