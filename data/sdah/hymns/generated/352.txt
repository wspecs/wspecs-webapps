352 - This Is My Will


1
This Is My Will, My One Command,
That Love Should Dwell Among You All.
This Is My Will That You Should Love
As I Have Shown That I Love You.

2
No Greater Love A Man Can Have
Than That He Die To Save His Friends.
You Are My Friends If You Obey
What I Command That You Should Do.

3
You Chose Not Me, But I Chose You
That You Should Go And Bear Much Fruit.
I Chose You Out That You In Me
Should Bear Much Fruit That Will Abide.

4
All That I Ask My Father, Dear,
For My Name'S Sake You Shall Receive.
This Is My Will, My One Command,
That Love Should Dwell In Each, In All.
