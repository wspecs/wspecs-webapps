056 - The Day Thou Gavest


1
The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, Is Ended;
The Darkness Falls At Thy Behest;
To Thee Our Morning Hymns Ascended;
Thy Praise Shall Hallow Now Our Rest.

2
We Thank Thee That Thy Church, Unsleeping
While Earth Rolls Onward Into Light,
Through All The World Her Watch Is Keeping,
And Rests Not Now By Day Or Night.

3
As O'Er Each Continent And Island
The Dawn Leads On Another Day,
The Voice Of Prayer Is Never Silent,
Nor Die The Strains Of Praise Away.

4
So Be It, Lord; Thy Throne Shall Never,
Like Earth'S Proud Empires, Pass Away.
Thy Kingdom Stands, And Grows Forever,
Till All Thy Creatures Own Thy Sway.
