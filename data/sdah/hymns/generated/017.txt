017 - Lord Of All Being, Throned Afar


1
Lord Of All Being, Throned Afar,
Thy Glory Flames From Sun And Star;
Center And Soul Of Every Sphere
Yet To Each Loving Heart How Near!
Yet To Each Loving Heart How Near!

2
Sun Of Our Life, Thy Quickening Ray
Shed On Our Path The Glow Of Day;
Star Of Our Hope, Thy Softened Light
Cheers The Long Watches Of The Night,
Cheers The Long Watches Of The Night.

3
Our Midnight Is Thy Smile Withdrawn;
Our Noontide Is Thy Gracious Dawn;
Our Rainbow Arch, Thy Mercy'S Sign;
All, Save The Clouds Of Sin, Are Thine,
All, Save The Clouds Of Sin, Are Thine.

4
Lord Of All Life, Below, Above
Whose Light Is Truth, Whose Warmth Is Love,
Before Thy Ever-Blazing Throne
We Ask No Luster Of Our Own,
We Ask No Luster Of Our Own.

5
Grant Us Thy Truth To Make Us Free
And Kindling Hearts That Burn For Thee;
Till All Thy Living Altars Claim
One Holy Light, One Heavenly Flame!
One Holy Light, One Heavenly Flame.
