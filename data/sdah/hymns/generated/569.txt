569 - Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior


1
Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior,
Hear My Humble Cry;
While On Others Thou Art Calling,
Do Not Pass Me By.

Refrain
Savior, Savior, Hear My Humble Cry;
While On Others Thou Art Calling,
Do Not Pass Me By.

2
Let Me At Thy Throne Of Mercy
Find A Sweet Relief,
Kneeling There In Deep Contrition;
Help My Unbelief.

3
Trusting Only In Thy Merit,
Would I Seek Thy Face;
Heal My Wounded, Broken Spirit,
Save Me By Thy Grace.

4
Thou The Spring Of All My Comfort,
More Than Life To Me,
Whom Have I On Earth Beside Thee?
Whom In Heaven But Thee?
