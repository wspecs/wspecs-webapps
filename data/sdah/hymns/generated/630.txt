630 - Rise, My Soul, And Stretch Thy Wings


1
Rise, My Soul, And Stretch Thy Wings,
Thy Better Portion Trace;
Rise From Transitory Things Toward Heaven,
Thy Native Place;
Sun, And Moon, And Stars Decay;
Time Shall Soon This Earth Remove;
Rise, My Soul, And Haste Away
To Seats Prepared Above.

2
Rivers To The Ocean Run,
Nor Stay In All Their Course;
Fire Ascending Seeks The Sun;
Both Speed Them To Their Source;
So A Soul That'S Born Of God,
Longs To View His Glorious Face,
Forward Tends To His Abode
To Rest In His Embrace.

3
Cease, Ye Pilgrims, Cease To Mourn;
Press Onward To The Prize;
Soon Our Savior Will Return,
Triumphant In The Skies;
Yet A Season, And You Know
Happy Entrance Will Be Given,
All Our Sorrows Left Below,
And Earth Exhcanged For Heaven.
