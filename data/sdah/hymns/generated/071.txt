071 - Come Thou Almighty King


1
Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help Us Thy Name To Sing,
Help Us To Praise!
Father All Glorious,
O'Er All Victorious,
Come, And Reign Over Us,
Ancient Of Days!

2
Come, Thou Incarnate Word,
Gird On Thy Mighty Sword,
Our Prayer Attend;
Come, And Thy People Bless,
And Give Thy Word Success;
Spirit Of Holiness,
On Us Descend!

3
Come, Holy Comforter,
Thy Sacred Witness Bear,
In This Glad Hour:
Thou Who Almighty Art,
Now Rule In Every Heart,
And Ne'Er From Us Depart,
Spirit Of Power!

4
To Thee, Great One In Three,
Eternal Praises Be,
Hence, Evermore:
Thy Sovereign Majesty
May We In Glory See,
And To Eternity
Love And Adore!
