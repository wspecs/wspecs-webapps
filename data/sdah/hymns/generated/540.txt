540 - Gentle Jesus, Meek And Mild


1
Gentle Jesus, Meek And Mild,
Look Upon A Little Child;
Pity My Simplicity,
Suffer Me To Come To Thee.

2
Lamb Of God, I Look To Thee;
Thou Shalt My Example Be;
Thou Art Gentle, Meek, And Mild,
Thou Wast Once A Little Child.

3
Fain I Would Be As Thou Art;
Give Me Thy Obedient Heart;
Thou Art Pitiful And Kind,
Let Me Have Thy Loving Mind.

4
I Shall Then Show Forth Thy Praise,
Serve Thee All My Happy Days;
Then The World Shall Always See
Christ, The Holy Child, In Me.
