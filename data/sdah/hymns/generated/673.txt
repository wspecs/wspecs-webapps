673 - May God Be With You


1
May God Be With You Till We Meet Again,
May God Be With You, Keep You Safe Till Then;
And May His Blessings Be Within Your Heart,
May God Be With You While We'Re Apart,
May God Be With You.

2
May God Be With You, Watch You From Above,
May God Protect You In His Tender Love;
And With The Dawning Of Each Bright, New Day,
May God Be With You, To Guide Your Way,
May God Be With You.
