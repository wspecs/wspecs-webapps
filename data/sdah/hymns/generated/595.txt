595 - Let Every Lamp Be Burning


1
Let Every Lamp Be Burning Bright,
The Darkest Hour Is Nearing;
The Darkest Hour Of Earth'S Long Night,
Before The Lord'S Appearing.

Refrain
Then Trim Your Lamps, My Brethren Dear,
Then Trim Your Lamps With Godly Fear;
The Master'S Coming Draweth Near,
Let Every Lamp Be Burning.

2
Though Thousands Calmly Slumber On,
The Last Great Message Spuring,
Wel'Ll Rest Our Living Faith Upon
His Promise Of Returning.

3
His Word Our Lamp, His Truth Our Guide,
We Cannot Be Mistaken;
Though Dangers Rise On Every Side,
We Shall Not Be Forsaken.

4
Then Let Good Works With Faith Appear,
To Help The World Atound Us;
Obedience Bring The Blessing Near
When Faith Has Firmly Bound Us.
