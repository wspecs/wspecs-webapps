497 - O Gracious Father Of Mankind


1
O Gracious Father Of Mankind,
Our Spirits' Unseen Friend;
High Heaven'S Lord, Our Hearts' Dear Guest,
To Thee Our Prayers Ascend.

2
Thou Dost Not Wait Till Human Speech
Thy Gifts Divine Implore;
Our Dreams, Our Aims, Our Work, Our Lives
Are Prayers Thou Lovest More.

3
Thou Hearest These, The Good And Ill,
Deep Buried In Each Breast;
The Secret Thought, The Hidden Plan,
Wrought Out Our Unexpressed.

4
O Cleanse Our Prayers From Human Dross,
Attune Our Lives To Thee,
Until We Labor For Those Gifts
We Ask On Bended Knee.

5
Our Best Is But Thyself In Us,
Our Highest Thought Thy Will;
To Hear Thy Voice We Need But Love,
And Listen, And Be Still.

6
We Would Not Bend Thy Will To Ours,
But Blend Our Wills To Thine;
Not Dreams, Our Aims, Our Work, Our Lives
Are Prayers Thou Lovest More.

7
Thou Seekest Us In Love And Truth
More Than Our Minds Seek Thee;
Through Open Gates Thy Power Flows In
Like Flood Tides From The Sea.

8
No More We Seek Thee From Afar,
Nor Ask Thee For A Sign,
Content To Pray In Life And Love
And Toil, Till All Are Thine.
