097 - Lord Of The Boundless Curves Of Space


1
Lord Of The Boundless Curves Of Space
And Time'S Deep Mystery,
To Your Creative Might We Trace
All Nature'S Energy.

2
Your Mind Conceived The Galaxy,
Each Atom'S Secret Planned,
And Every Age Of History
Your Purpose, Lord, Has Spanned.

3
Yours Is The Image Stamped On Man,
Though Marred By Man'S Own Sin;
And Yours The Liberating Plan
Again His Soul To Win.

4
Give Us To Know Your Truth; But More,
The Strength To Do Your Will;
Until The Love Our Souls Adore
Shall All Our Being Fill.
