406 - Love Consecrates The Humblest Act


1
Love Consecrates The Humblest Act
And Haloes Mercy'S Deeds;
It Sheds A Benediction Sweet
And Hallows Human Needs.

2
When In The Shadow Of The Cross
Christ Knelt And Washed The Feet
Of His Disciples, He Gave Us
A Sign Of Love Complete.

3
Love Serves And Willing, Stoops To Serve;
What Christ In Love So True
Has Freely Done For One And All,
Let Us Now Gladly Do!
