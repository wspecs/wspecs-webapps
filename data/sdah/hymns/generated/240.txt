240 - Fairest Lord Jesus


1
Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler Of All Nature,
O Thou Of God And Man The Son!
Thee Will I Cherish, Thee Will I Honor,
Thou, My Soul'S Glory, Joy, And Crown.

2
Fair Are The Meadows, Fairer Still The Woodlands,
Robed In The Blooming Garb Of Spring:
Jesus Is Fairer, Jesus Is Purer
Who Makes The Woeful Heart To Sing.

3
Fair Is The Sunshine, Fairer Still The Moonlight,
And All The Twinkling Starry Host:
Jesus Shines Brighter, Jesus Shines Purer
Than All The Angels Heaven Can Boast.

4
Beautiful Savior! Lord Of All The Nations,
Son Of God And Son Of Man!
Glory And Honor, Praise, Adoration,
Now And Forevermore Be Thine!
