154 - When I Survey The Wondrous Cross


1
When I Survey The Wondrous Cross
On Which The Prince Of Glory Died;
My Richest Gain I Count But Loss,
And Pour Contempt On All My Pride.

2
Forbid It, Lord, That I Should Boast,
Save In The Death Of Christ, My God;
All The Vain Things That Charm Me Most,
I Sacrifice Them To His Blood.

3
See, From His Head, His Hands, His Feet,
Sorrow And Love Flow Mingled Down.
Did E'Er Such Love And Sorrow Meet,
Or Thorns Compose So Rich A Crown.

4
Were The Whole Realm Of Nature Mine,
That Were An Offering Far Too Small;
Love So Amazing, So Divine,
Demands My Soul, My Life, My All.
