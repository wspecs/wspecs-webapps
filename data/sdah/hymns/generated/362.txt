362 - Lift High The Cross


Refrain
Lift High The Cross, The Love Of Christ Proclaim,
Till All The World Adore His Sacred Name.

1
Come, Christians, Follow Where Our Captain Trod,
Our King Victorious, Christ, The Son Of God.

2
Led On Their Way By This Triumphant Sign,
The Hosts Of God In Conquering Ranks Combine.

3
All Newborn Soldiers Of The Crucified
Bear On Their Brows The Seal Of Him Who Died.

4
O Lord, Once Lifted On The Glorious Tree,
As Thou Hast Promised, Draw Us All To Thee.

5
So Shall Our Song Of Triumph Ever Be:
Praise To The Crucified For Victory!
