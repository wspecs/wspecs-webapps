653 - Lead Them, My God, To Thee


1
Lead Them, My God, To Thee, Lead Them To Thee,
These Children Dear Of Mine, Thou Gavest Me;
O, By Thy Love Divine,
Lead Them, My God, To Thee;
Lead Them, My God, To Thee, Lead Them To Thee.

2
When Earth Looks Bright And Fair, Festive And Gay,
Let No Delusive Snare Lure Them Astray;
But From Temptation'S Power,
Lead Them, My God, To Thee,
Lead Them, My God, To Thee, Lead Them To Thee.

3
E'En For Such Little Ones, Christ Came A Child,
And In This World Of Sin Lived Undefiled.
O, For His Sake, I Pray,
Lead Them, My God, To Thee,
Lead Them, My God, To Thee, Lead Them To Thee.

4
Yea, Though My Faith Be Dim, I Would Believe
That Thou This Precious Gift Wilt Now Receive;
O Take Their Young Hearts Now,
Lead Them My God To Thee,
Lead Them, My God, To Thee, Lead Them To Thee.
