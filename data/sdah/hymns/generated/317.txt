317 - Lead Me To Calvary


1
King Of My Life, I Crown Thee Now,
Thine Shall The Glory Be;
Lest I Forget Thy Thorn Crowned Brow,
Lead Me To Calvary.

Refrain
Lest I Forget Gethsemane,
Lest I Forget Thine Agony;
Lest I Forget Thy Love For Me,
Lead Me To Calvary.

2
Show Me The Tomb Where Thou Wast Laid,
Tenderly Mourned And Wept;
Angels In Robes Of Light Arrayed
Guarded Thee Whilst Thou Slept.

3
Let Me Like Mary, Through The Gloom,
Come With A Gift To Thee;
Show To Me Now The Empty Tomb,
Lead Me To Calvary.

4
May I Be Willing, Lord, To Bear
Daily My Cross For Thee;
Even Thy Cup Of Grief To Share,
Thou Hast Borne All For Me.
