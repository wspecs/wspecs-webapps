557 - Come, Ye Thankful People


1
Come, Ye Thankful People, Come,
Raise The Song Of Harvest Home;
All Is Safely Gathered In,
Ere The Winter Storms Begin.
God Our Maker Doth Provide
For Our Wants To Be Supplied;
Come To God'S Own Temple, Come;
Raise The Song Of Harvest Home!

2
We Ourselves Are God'S Own Field,
Fruit Unto His Praise To Yield;
Wheat And Tares Together Sown,
Unto Joy Or Sorrow Grown;
First The Blade And Then The Ear,
Then The Full Corn Shall Appear;
Grant, O Harvest Lord, That We
Wholesome Grain And Pure May Be.

3
For The Lord Our God Shall Come,
And Shall Take His Harvest Home;
From His Field Shall Purge Away
All That Doth Offend, That Day;
Give His Angels Charge At Last
In The Fire The Tares To Cast;
But The Fruitful Ears To Store
In His Garner Evermore.

4
Then, Thou Church Triumphant, Come,
Raise The Song Of Harvest Home;
All Are Safely Gathered In,
Free From Sorrow, Free From Sin,
There, Forever Purified,
In God'S Garner To Abide;
Come, Ten Thousand Angels, Come,
Raise The Glorious Harvest Home!
