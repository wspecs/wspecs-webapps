134 - O Jesus Sweet


1
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild,
Thy Father'S Will Hast Thou Fulfilled;
For Thou Hast Left Thy Heavenly Throne
Our Lowly State To Make Thine Own.
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild.

2
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild,
With Joy Hast Thou The Whole World Filled;
Thou Comest Down From Heaven'S Hall
To Comfort Us Whom Tears Enthrall.
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild.

3
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild,
Thou Art Love'S Image Undefiled.
Inflame Our Hearts With Love'S Pure Fire,
That We May Share Thy Heart'S Desire.
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild.

4
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild,
Help Us To Do As Thou Hast Willed.
What'Er We Have Belongs To Thee:
O May We Ever Faithful Be.
O Jesus Sweet, O Jesus Mild.
