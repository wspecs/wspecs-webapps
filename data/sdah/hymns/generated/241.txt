241 - Jesus, The Very Thought Of Thee


1
Jesus, The Very Thought Of Thee
With Sweetness Fills The Breast;
But Sweeter Far Thy Face To See,
And In Thy Presence Rest.

2
No Voice Can Sing, No Heart Can Frame,
Nor Can The Memory Find
A Sweeter Sound Than Jesus' Name,
The Savior Of Mankind.

3
O Hope Of Every Contrite Heart!
O Joy Of All The Meek,
To Those Who Fall, How Kind Thou Art!
How Good To Those Who Seek!

4
But What To Those Who Find? Ah, This
Nor Tongue Nor Pen Can Show;
The Love Of Jesus, What It Is,
None But His Loved Ones Know.

5
Jesus, Our Only Joy Be Thou,
As Thou Our Prize Wilt Be;
Jesus, Be Thou Our Glory Now,
And Through Eternity.
