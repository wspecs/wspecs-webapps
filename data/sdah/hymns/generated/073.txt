073 - Holy Holy Holy


1
Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early In The Morning Our Song Shall Rise To Thee;
Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful And Mighty!
God In Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!

2
Holy, Holy, Holy! Angels Adore Thee,
Casting Down Their Golden Crowns
Around The Glassy Sea;
Thousands And Ten Thousands Worship Low Before Thee,
Which Wert, And Art, And Evermore Shalt Be.

3
Holy, Holy, Holy! Though The Darkness Hide Thee,
Though The Eye Of Sinful Man Thy Glory May Not See;
Only Thou Art Holy; There Is None Beside Thee,
Perfect In Power, In Love, And Purity.

4
Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!
All Thy Works Shall Praise Thy Name,
In Earth, And Sky, And Sea;
Holy, Holy, Holy; Merciful And Mighty!
God In Three Persons, Blessed Trinity!
