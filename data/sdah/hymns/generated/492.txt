492 - Like Jesus


1
Teach, Me, Father, What To Say;
Teach Me, Father, How To Pray;
Teach Me All Along The Way
How To Be Like Jesus.

Refrain
I Would Be Like Jesus,
I Would Be Like Jesus!
Help Me, Lord, To Daily Grow
More And More Like Jesus!

2
Teach Me As The Days Go By,
Teach Me Not To Reason Why,
Teach Me That To Do And Die,
Is To Be Like Jesus.

3
Teach Me That The Time Is Short,
Teach Me How To Live And Work,
Teach Me That To Never Shirk
Is To Be Like Jesus.

4
Teach Me How We May Be One,
Like The Father And The Son;
And When All Is Overcome,
I Will Be Like Jesus.
