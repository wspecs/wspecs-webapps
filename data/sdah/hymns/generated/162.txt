What Wondrous Love Is This,
O My Soul, O My Soul?
What Wondrous Love Is This, O My Soul?
What Wondrous Love Is This
That Caused The Lord Of Bliss
To Bear The Dreadful Curse For My Soul, For My Soul;
To Bear The Dreadful Curse For My Soul, For My Soul;

To God And To The Lamb
I Will Sing, I Will Sing;
To God And To The Lamb, I Will Sing;
To God And To The Lamb
Who Is The Great I Am,
While Millions Join The Theme, I Will Sing, I Will Sing;
While Millions Join The Theme, I Will Sing, I Will Sing;

And When From Death I'M Free,
I'Ll Sing On, I'Ll Sing On;
And When From Death I'M Free, I'Ll Sing On;
And When From Death I'M Free,
I'Ll Sing And Joyful Be,
And Through Eternity I'Ll Sing On, I'Ll Sing On!
And Through Eternity, I'Ll Sing On.
