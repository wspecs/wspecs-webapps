344 - I Love Your Kingdom, Lord


1
I Love Thy Kingdom, Lord,
The House Of Thine Abode,
The Church Our Blest Redeemer Saved
With His Own Precious Blood.

2
I Love Thy Church, O God!
Her Walls Before Thee Stand
Dear As The Apple Of Thine Eye,
And Graven On Thy Hand.

3
Beyond My Highest Joy
I Prize Her Heavenly Ways,
Her Sweet Communion, Solemn Vows,
Her Hymns Of Love And Praise.

4
Sure As Thy Truth Shall Last,
To Zion Shall Be Given
The Brightest Glories Earth Can Yield,
And Brighter Bliss Of Heaven.
