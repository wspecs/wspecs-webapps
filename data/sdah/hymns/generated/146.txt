146 - I Think When I Read That Sweet Story


1
I Think When I Read That Sweet Story Of Old,
When Jesus Was Here Among Men,
How He Called Little Children As Lambs To His Fold,
I Should Like To Have Been With Him Then.

2
I Wish That His Hands Had Been Placed On My Head,
That His Arm Had Been Thrown Around Me,
And That I Might Have Seen His Kind Look When He Said,
"Let The Little Ones Come Unto Me."

3
I Long For The Joy Of That Glorious Time,
The Sweetest And Brightest And Best,
When The Dear Little Children Of Every Clime
Shall Crowd To His Arms And Be Blest.
