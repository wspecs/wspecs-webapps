518 - Standing On The Promises


1
Standing On The Promises Of Christ My King,
Thru Eternal Ages Let His Praises Ring;
Glory In The Highest I Will Shout And Sing,
Standing On The Promises Of God.

Refrain
Standing, Standing,
Standing On The Promises
Of God My Savior;
Standing, Standing,
I'M Standing On The Promises Of God.

2
Standing On The Promises That Cannot Fail,
When The Howling Storms Of Doubt And Fear Assail,
By The Living Word Of God I Shall Prevail,
Standing On The Promises Of God.

3
Standing On The Promises Of Christ The Lord,
Bound To Him Eternally By Love'S Strong Cord,
Overcoming Daily With The Spirit'S Sword,
Standing On The Promises Of God.
