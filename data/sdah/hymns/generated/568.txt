568 - Make Me A Captive, Lord


1
Make Me A Captive, Lord,
And Then I Shall Be Free;
Force Me To Render Up My Sword,
And I Shall Conqueror Be.
I Sink In Life'S Alarms
When By Myself I Stand;
Imprison Me Within Thine Arms,
And Strong Shall Be My Hand.

2
My Heart Is Weak And Poor
Until It Amaster Find;
It Has No Spring Of Action Sure,
It Varies With The Wind.
It Cannot Freely Move Till
Thou Has Wrought Its Chain;
Enslave It With Thy Matchless Love,
And Deathless It Shall Reign.

3
My Will Is Not My Own Till
Thou Hast Made It Thine;
If It Would Reach A Monarch'S Throne,
It Must Its Crown Resign;
It Only Stands Unbent,
Amid The Clashing Strife,
When On Thy Bosom It Has Leant,
And Found In Thee Its Life.
