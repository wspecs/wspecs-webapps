130 - It Came Upon The Midnight Clear


1
It Came Upon The Midnight Clear,
That Glorious Song Of Old,
From Angels Bending Near The Earth,
To Touch Their Harps Of Gold:
"Peace On The Earth, Goodwill To Men
From Heavens All Gracious King!"
The World In Solemn Stillness Lay
To Hear The Angels Sing.

2
Still Through The Cloven Skies They Come,
With Peaceful Wings Unfurled;
And Still Their Heavenly Music Floats
O'Er All The Weary World:
Above Its Sad And Lowly Plains
They Bend On Hovering Wing,
And Ever O'Er Its Babel Sounds
The Blessed Angels Sing.

3
O Ye Beneath Life'S Crushing Load,
Whose Forms Are Bending Low,
Who Toil Along The Climbing Way
With Painful Steps And Slow;
Look Now, For Glad And Golden Hours
Come Swiftly On The Wing;
Oh Rest Beside The Weary Road
And Hear The Angels Sing.
