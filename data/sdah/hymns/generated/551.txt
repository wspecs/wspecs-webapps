551 - Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me


1
Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me
Over Life'S Tempestuous Sea;
Unknown Waves Before Me Roll,
Hiding Rock And Treacherous Shoal.
Chart And Compass Come From Thee;
Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me.

2
As A Mother Stills Her Child,
Thou Canst Hush The Ocean Wild;
Boisterous Waves Obey Thy Will,
When Thou Sayest To Them, "Be Still!"
Wondrous Sovreign Of The Sea,
Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me.

3
When At Last I Near The Shore,
And The Fearful Breakers Roar
'Twixt Me And The Peaceful Rest,
Then, While Leaning On Thy Breast,
May I Hear Thee Say To Me,
"Fear Not, I Will Pilot Thee.
