309 - I Surrender All


1
All To Jesus I Surrender;
All To Him I Freely Give;
I Will Ever Love And Trust Him,
In His Presence Daily Live.

Refrain
I Surrender All, I Surrender All,
All To Thee, My Blessed Savior,
I Surrender All.

2
All To Jesus I Surrender;
Humbly At His Feet I Bow,
Worldly Pleasures All Forsaken;
Take Me, Jesus, Take Me Now.

3
All To Jesus I Surrender;
Make Me, Savior, Wholly Thine;
Fill Me With Thy Love And Power;
Truly Know That Thou Art Mine.

4
All To Jesus I Surrender;
Now I Feel The Sacred Flame.
O The Joy Of Full Salvation!
Glory, Glory, To His Name!
