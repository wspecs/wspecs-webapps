093 - All Things Bright And Beautiful


Refrain
All Things Bright And Beautiful
All Creatures Great And Small
All Things Wise And Wonderful
The Lord God Made Them All.

1
Each Little Flow'R That Opens
Each Little Bird That Sings
He Made Their Glowing Colours
He Made Their Tiny Wings.

2
The Purple-Headed Mountain
The River Running By
The Sunset And The Morning
That Brighten Up The Sky.

3
The Cold Wind In The Winter
The Pleasant Summer Sun
The Ripe Fruits In The Garden
He Made Them, Every One.

4
He Gave Us Eyes To See Them
And Lips That We Might Tell
How Great Is God Almighty
Who Has Made All Things Well.
