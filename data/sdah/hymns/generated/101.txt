101 - Children Of The Heavenly Father


1
Children Of The Heavenly Father
Safely In His Bossom Gather;
Nestling Bird Nor Star In Heaven
Such A Refuge E'Er Was Given.

2
God His Own Doth Tend And Nourish,
In His Holy Love They Flourish;
From All Evil Things He Spares Them,
In His Mighty Arms He Bears Them.

3
Neither Life Nor Death Shall Ever
From The Lord His Children Sever;
Unto Them His Grace He Showeth,
And Their Sorrows All He Knoweth.

4
Praise The Lord In Joyful Numbers,
Your Protector Never Slumbers;
At The Will Of Your Defender
Every Foe-Man Must Surrender.

5
Though He Giveth Or He Taketh,
God His Children Ne'Er Forsaketh;
His The Loving Purpose Solely
To Preserve Them Pure And Holy.
