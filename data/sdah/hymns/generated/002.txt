All Creatures Of Our God And King
Lift Up Your Voice And With Us Sing,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
O Burning Sun With Golden Beam
And Silver Moon With Softer Gleam!

O Praise Him! O Praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

O Rushing Wind And Breezes Soft,
O Clouds That Ride The Winds Aloft,
O Praise Him! Alleluia!
O Rising Morn, In Praise Rejoice,
O Lights Of Evening, Find A Voice!

O Flowing Waters, Pure And Clear,
Make Music For Your Lord To Hear,
O Praise Him! Alleluia!
O Fire So Masterful And Bright,
Providing Us With Warmth And Light.

Let All Things Their Creator Bless,
And Worship Him In Humbleness,
O Praise Him! Alleluia!
Oh, Praise The Father, Praise The Son,
And Praise The Spirit, Three In One!
