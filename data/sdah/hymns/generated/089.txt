089 - Let All On Earth Their Voices Raise


1
Let All On Earth Their Voices Raise,
To Sing The Great Jehovah'S Praise,
And Bless His Holy Name:
His Glory Let The People Know,
His Wonders To The Nations Show,
His Saving Grace Proclaim.

2
He Framed The Globe; He Built The Sky;
He Made The Shining Worlds On High,
And Reigns In Glory There:
His Beams Are Majesty And Light;
His Beauties, How Divinely Bright!
His Dwelling Place, How Fair!

3
Come, The Great Day, The Glorious Hour,
When Earth Shall Feel His Saving Power,
All Nations Fear His Name;
Then Shall The Race Of Men Confess
The Beauty Of His Holiness,
His Saving Grace Proclaim.
