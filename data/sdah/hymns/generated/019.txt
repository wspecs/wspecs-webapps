019 - O Sing A New Song To The Lord


1
O Sing A New Song To The Lord
For Marvels He Has Done;
His Right Hand And His Holy Arm
The Victory Have Won.

2
With Harp, And Voice Of Psalms
Unto Jehovah Sing;
Let Trumpets And The Echoing Horn
Acclaim The Lord Our King!

3
Let Seas With All Their Creatures Roar,
The World And Dwellers There,
And Let The Rivers Clap Their Hands,
The Hills Their Joy Declare.

4
Before The Lord: Because He Comes,
To Judge The Earth Come He;
He'Ll Judge The World
With Righteousness,
His Folk With Equity.
