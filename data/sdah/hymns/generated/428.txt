428 - Sweet By And By


1
There'S A Land That Is Fairer Than Day,
And By Faith We Can See It Afar;
For The Father Waits Over The Way
To Prepare Us A Dwelling Place There.

Refrain
In The Sweet In The Sweet
By And By By And By,
We Shall Meet On That Beautiful Shore;
In The Sweet In The Sweet
By And By By And By
We Shall Meet On That Beautiful Shore.

2
We Shall Sing On That Beautiful Shore
The Melodious Songs Of The Blest,
And Our Spirits Shall Sorrow No More
Not A Sigh For The Blessing Of Rest.

3
To Our Bountiful Father Above
We Will Offer Our Tribute Of Praise;
For The Glorious Gift Of His Love
And The Blessings That Hallow Our Days.
