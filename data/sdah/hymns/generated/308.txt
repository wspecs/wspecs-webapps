308 - Wholly Thine


1
I Would Be, Dear Savior, Wholly Thine;
Teach Me How, Teach Me How;
I Would Do Thy Will, O Lord, Not Mine;
Help Me, Help Me Now.

Refrain
Wholly Thine, Wholly Thine,
Wholly Thine, This Is My Vow;
Wholly Thine, Wholly Thine,
Wholly Thine, O Lord, Just Now.

2
What Is Worldly Pleasure, Wealth Or Fame,
Without Thee, Without Thee?
I Will Leave Them All For Thy Dear Name,
This My Wealth Shall Be.

3
As I Cast Earth'S Transient Joys Behind,
Come Thou Near, Come Thou Near;
In Thy Presence All In All I Find,
'Tis My Comfort Here.
