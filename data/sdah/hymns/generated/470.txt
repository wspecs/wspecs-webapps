470 - There'S Sunshine In My Soul Today


1
There'S Sunshine In My Soul Today,
More Glorious And Bright
Than Glows In Any Earthly Sky,
For Jesus Is My Light.

Refrain
O There'S Sunshine, Blessed Sunshine,
When The Peaceful, Happy Moments Roll
When Jesus Shows His Smiling Face
There Is Sunshine In The Soul.

2
There'S Music In My Soul Today,
A Carol To My King,
And Jesus, Listening, Can Hear
The Songs I Cannot Sing.

3
There'S Springtime In My Soul Today,
For When The Lord Is Near,
The Dove Of Peace Sings In My Heart,
The Flowers Of Grace Appear.

4
Theres Gladness In My Soul Today,
And Hope, And Praise, And Love,
For Blessings Which He Gives Me Now,
For Joys "Laid Up" Above.
