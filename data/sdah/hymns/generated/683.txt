683 - Jesus, Stand Among Us


1
Jesus, Stand Among Us
In Thy Risen Power;
Let This Time Of Worship
Be A Hallowed Hour.

2
Breathe The Holy Spirit
Into Every Heart;
Bid The Fears And Sorrows
From Each Soul Depart.

3
Thus With Quickened Footsteps
We Pursue Our Way,
Watching For The Dawning
Of Eternal Day.
