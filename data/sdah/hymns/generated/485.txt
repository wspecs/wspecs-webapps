485 - I Must Tell Jesus


1
I Must Tell Jesus All Of My Trials,
I Cannot Bear These Burdens Alone;
In My Distress He Kindly Will Help Me,
He Ever Loves And Cares For His Own.

Refrain
I Must Tell Jesus! I Must Tell Jesus!
I Cannot Bear My Burdens Alone;
I Must Tell Jesus! I Must Tell Jesus!
Jesus Can Help Me, Jesus Alone.

2
I Must Tell Jesus All Of My Troubles,
He Is A Kind, Compassionate Friend;
If I But Ask Him He Will Deliver,
Make Of My Troubles Quickly An End.

3
Oh, How The World To Evil Allures Me!
Oh, How My Heart Is Tempted To Sin!
I Must Tell Jesus, And He Will Help Me
Over The World The Vict'Ry To Win.
