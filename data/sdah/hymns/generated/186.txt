186 - I'Ve Found A Friend


1
I'Ve Found A Friend; Oh, Such A Friend!
He Loved Me Ere I Knew Him;
He Drew Me With The Cords Of Love,
And Thus He Bound Me To Him.
And 'Round My Heart Still Closely Twine
Those Ties Which Nought Can Sever,
For I Am His, And He Is Mine,
Forever And Forever.

2
I'Ve Found A Friend; Oh, Such A Friend!
He Bled, He Died To Save Me;
And Not Alone The Gift Of Life,
But His Own Self He Gave Me.
Nought That I Have My Own I Call,
I Hold It For The Giver;
My Heart, My Strength, My Life My All,
Are His, And His Forever.

3
I'Ve Found A Friend; Oh, Such A Friend!
All Power To Him Is Given;
To Guard Me On My Upward Course,
And Bring Me Safe To Heaven.
The Eternal Glories Gleam Afar,
To Nerve My Faint Endeavor;
So Now To Watch, To Work, To War,
And Then To Rest Forever.

4
I'Ve Found A Friend; Oh, Such A Friend!
So Kind, And True, And Tender,
So Wise A Counselor And Guide,
So Mighty A Defender.
From Him, Who Loveth Me So Well,
What Power My Soul Can Sever?
Shall Life Or Death, Or Earth, Or Hell?
No; I Am His Forever.
