522 - My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less


1
My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less
Than Jesus' Blood And Righteousness.
I Dare Not Trust The Sweetest Frame,
But Wholly Lean On Jesus' Name.

Refrain
On Christ The Solid Rock I Stand;
All Other Ground Is Sinking Sand,
All Other Ground Is Sinking Sand.

2
When Darkness Veils His Lovely Face,
I Rest On His Unchanging Grace.
In Every High And Stormy Gale,
My Anchor Holds Within The Veil.

3
His Oath, His Covenant, His Blood
Supports Me In The Whelming Flood.
When All Around My Soul Gives Way,
He Then Is All My Hope And Stay.

4
When He Shall Come With Trumpet Sound,
O May I Then In Him Be Found!
Dressed In His Righteousness Alone,
Faultless To Stand Before The Throne.
