573 - I'Ll Go Where You Want Me To Go


1
It May Not Be On The Mountain Height
Or Over The Stormy Sea,
It May Not Be At The Battle'S Front
My Lord Will Have Need Of Me.
But If, By A Still, Small Voice He Calls
To Paths That I Do Not Know,
I'Ll Answer, Dear Lord, With My Hand In Thine;
I'Ll Go Where You Want Me To Go.

Refrain
I'Ll Go Where You Want Me To Go, Dear Lord,
Over Mountain Or Plain Or Sea;
I'Ll Say What You Want Me To Say, Dear Lord;
I'Ll Be What You Want Me To Be.

2
Perhaps Today There Are Loving Words
Which Jesus Would Have Me Speak
There May Be Now In The Paths Of Sin
Some Wand'Rer Whom I Should Seek.
O Savior, If Thou Wilt Be My Guide,
Tho Dark And Rugged The Way,
My Voice Shall Echo The Message Sweet;
I'Ll Say What You Want Me To Say.

3
There'S Surely Somewhere A Lowly Place
In Earth'S Harvest Fields So Wide
Where I May Labor Through Life'S Short Day
For Jesus, The Crucified.
So Trusting My All To Thy Tender Care,
And Knowing Thou Lovest Me,
I'Ll Do Thy Will With A Heart Sincere:
I'Ll Be What You Want Me To Be.
