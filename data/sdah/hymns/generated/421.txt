421 - For All The Saints


1
For All The Saints
Who From Their Labors Rest,
Who Thee By Faith
Before The World Confessed.
Thy Name, O Jesus,
Be Forever Blest.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

2
Thou Wast Their Rock,
Their Fortress And Their Might;
Thou, Lord, Their Captain
In The Well-Fought Fight;
Thou, In The Darkness Drear,
Their One True Light.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

3
O May Thy Soldiers,
Faithful, True, And Bold,
Fight As The Saints
Who Nobly Fought Of Old,
And Win With Them
The Victor'S Crown Of Gold.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

4
And When The Strife Is Fierce,
The Warfare Long,
Steals On The Ear
The Distant Triumph Song,
And Hearts Are Brave Again,
And Arms Are Strong.
Alleluia!
Alleluia!

5
From Earth'S Wide Bounds,
From Ocean'S Farthest Coast,
Thro' Gates Of Pearl
Streams In The Countless Host,
Singing To Father,
Son, And Holy Ghost,
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
