156 - O Sacred Head Now Wounded


1
O Sacred Head, Now Wounded,
With Grief And Shame Weighed Down,
Now Scornfully Surounded
With Thorns, Thine Only Crown:
How Pale Thou Art With Anguish,
With Sore Abuse And Scorn!
How Does That Visage Languish
Which Once Was Bright As Morn!

2
What Thou, My Lord, Has Suffered
Was All For Sinners' Gain;
Mine, Mine Was The Transgression,
But Thine The Deadly Pain.
Lo, Here I Fall, My Savior!
'Tis I Deserve Thy Place;
Look On Me With Thy Favor,
Vouchsafe To Me Thy Grace.

3
What Language Shall I Borrow
To Thank Thee, Dearest Friend,
For This Thy Dying Sorrow,
Thy Pity Without End?
O Make Me Thine Forever;
And Should I Fainting Be,
Lord, Let Me Never, Never
Outlive My Love For Thee.
