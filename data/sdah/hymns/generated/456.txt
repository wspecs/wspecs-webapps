456 - My Lord And I


1
I Have A Friend So Precious,
So Very Dear To Me,
He Loves Me With Such Tender Love,
He Loves So Faithfully;
I Could Not Live Apart Form Him,
I Love To Feel Him Nigh,
And So We Dwell Together,
My Lord And I.

2
Sometimes I'M Faint And Weary,
He Knows That I Am Weak,
And As He Bids Me Lean On Him,
His Help I Gladly Seek;
He Leads Me In The Paths Of Light,
Beneath A Sunny Sky,
And So We Walk Together,
My Lord And I.

3
I Tell Him All My Sorrows,
I Tell Him All My Joys,
I Tell Him All That Pleases Me,
I Tell Him What Annoys;
He Tells Me What I Ought To Do,
He Tells Me How To Try,
And So We Talk Together,
My Lord And I.

4
He Knows That I Am Longing
Some Weary Soul To Win,
And So He Bids Me Go And Speak
The Loving Word For Him;
He Bids Me Tell His Wondrous Love,
And Why He Came To Die,
And So We Work Together,
My Lord And I.
