466 - Wonderful Peace


1
Far Away In The Depths Of My Spirit Tonight,
Rolls A Melody Sweeter Than Psalm;
In Celestial Like Strains It Unceasingly Falls
O'Er My Soul Like An Infinite Calm.

Refrain
Peace! Peace! Wonderful Peace,
Coming Down From The Father Above;
Sweep Over My Spirit Forever, I Pray,
In Fathomless Billows Of Love.

2
What A Treasure I Have In This Wonderful Peace,
Buried Deep In My Inner Most Soul,
So Secure That No Power Can Mine It Away,
While The Years Of Eternity Roll!

3
I Believe When I Rise To That City Of Peace,
Where The Author Of Peace I Shall See,
That One Strain Of The Song Which The Ransomed Will Sing,
In That Heavenly Kingdom Will Be-

4
Weary Soul, Without Gladness Or Comfort Or Rest,
Passing Down The Rough Pathway Of Time!
Make The Savior Your Friend Ere The Shadows Grow Dark;
O Accept Of This Peace So Sublime.
