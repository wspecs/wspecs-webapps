128 - Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light


1
Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light,
And Usher In The Morning;
Ye Shepherds, Shrink Not With Affright,
But Hear The Angel'S Warning.
This Child, Now Weak In Infancy,
Our Confidence And Joy Shall Be,
The Power Of Satan Breaking,
Our Peace Eternal Making.

2
Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light,
To Herald Our Salvation;
He Stoops To Earth - The God Of Might,
Our Hope And Expectation.
He Comes In Human Flesh To Dwell,
Our God With Us, Immanuel,
The Night Of Darkness Ending,
Our Fallen Race Befriending.
