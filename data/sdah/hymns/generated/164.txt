164 - There Is A Green Hill Far Away


1
There Is A Green Hill Far Away,
Without A City Wall,
Where The Dear Lord Was Crucified,
Who Died To Save Us All.

2
We May Not Know, We Cannot Tell,
What Pains He Had To Bear,
But We Believe It Was For Us
He Hung And Suffered There.

3
He Died That We Might Be Forgiven,
He Died To Make Us Good,
That We Might Go At Last To Heaven,
Saved By His Precious Blood.

4
There Was No Other Good Enough
To Pay The Price Of Sin;
He Only Could Unlock The Gate
Of Heaven, And Let Us In.

5
O Dearly, Dearly Has He Loved!
And We Must Love Him Too,
And Trust In His Redeeming Blood,
And Try His Works To Do.
