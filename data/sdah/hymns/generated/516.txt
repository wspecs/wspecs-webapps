516 - All The Way


1
All The Way My Savior Leads Me;
What Have I To Ask Beside?
Can I Doubt His Tender Mercy,
Who Through Life Has Been My Guide?
Heavenly Peace, Divinest Comfort,
Here By Faith In Him To Dwell;
For I Know Whate'Er Befall Me,
Jesus Doeth All Things Well;
For I Know Whate'Er Befall Me,
Jesus Doeth All Things Well.

2
All The Way My Savior Leads Me;
Cheers Each Winding Path I Tread;
Gives Me Grace For Every Trial,
Feeds Me With The Living Bread;
Though My Weary Steps May Falter,
And My Soul Athirst May Be,
Gushing From The Rock Before Me,
Lo, A Spring Of Joy I See;
Gushing From The Rock Before Me,
Lo, A Spring Of Joy I See.

3
All The Way My Savior Leads Me;
O The Fullness Of His Love!
Perfect Rest To Me Is Promised
In My Father'S House Above;
When I Wake To Life Immortal,
Wing My Flight To Realms Of Day,
This My Song Through Endless Ages,
Jesus Led Me All The Way;
This My Song Through Endless Ages,
Jesus Led Me All The Way.
