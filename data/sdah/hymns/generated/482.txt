482 - Father, Lead Me Day By Day


1
Father, Lead Me Day By Day,
Ever In Thine Own Sweet Way;
Teach Me To Be Pure And True;
Show Me What I Ought To Do.

2
When In Danger, Make Me Brave;
Make Me Know That Thou Canst Save;
Keep Me Safe By Thy Dear Side;
Let Me In Thy Love Abide.

3
When Tempted To Do Wrong,
Make Me Steadfast, Wise, And Strong;
And When All Alone I Stand,
Shield Me With Thy Mighty Hand.

4
May I Do The Good I Know,
Be Thy Loving Child Below,
Then At Last Go Home To Thee,
Evermore Thy Child To Be.
