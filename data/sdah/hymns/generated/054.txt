054 - O Gladsome Light


1
O Gladsome Light,
Of God The Father'S Face,
The Eternal Splendour Wearing;
Celestial, Holy, Blest,
Our Saviour, Jesus Christ,
Joyful In Thine Appearing.

2
Now E'Er Day Fadeth Quite,
We See The Evening Light,
Our Wonted Hymn Outpouring;
Father Of Might Unknown,
Thee His Incarnate Son,
And Holy Spirit Adoring.

3
To Thee Of Right Belongs
All Praise Of Holy Songs,
O Son Of God, Life Giver;
Thee, Therefore, O Most High,
The World Doth Glorify
And Shall Exalt Forever.
