680 - Holy Spirit, Hear Us


1
Holy Spirit, Hear Us;
Help Us While We Sing;
Breath Into The Music
Of The Praise We Bring.

2
Holy Spirit, Prompt Us
When We Kneel To Pray;
Nearer Come, And Teach Us
What We Ought To Say.

3
Holy Spirit, Shine Thou
On The Book We Read;
Gild It'S Holy Pages
With The Light We Need.
