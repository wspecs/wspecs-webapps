O Love Of God Most Full,
O Love Of God Most Free,
Come Warm My Heart, Come Fill My Soul,
Come Lead Me Unto Thee.

2
Warm As The Glowing Sun
So Shines Thy Love On Me,
It Wraps Me 'Round With Kindly Care,
It Draws Me Unto Thee.

3
The Wildest Sea Is Calm,
The Tempest Brings No Fear,
The Darkest Night Is Full Of Light,
Because Thy Love Is Near.

4
O Love Of God Most Full,
O Love Of God Most Free,
It Warms My Heart, It Fills My Soul,
With Might It Strengthens Me.
