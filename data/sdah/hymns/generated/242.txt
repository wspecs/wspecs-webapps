242 - Jesus, Thou Joy Of Loving Hearts


1
Jesus, Thou Joy Of Loving Hearts!
Thou Fount Of Life! Thou Light Of Men!
From The Best Bliss That Earth Imparts,
We Turn Unfilled To Thee Again.

2
Thy Truth Unchanged Has Ever Stood;
Thou Savest Those That On Thee Call;
To Them That Seek Thee Thou Art Good,
To Them That Find Thee, All In All.

3
We Taste Thee, O Thou Living Bread,
And Long To Feast Upon Thee Still;
We Drink Of Thee, The Fountainhead,
And Thirst Our Souls From Thee To Fill!

4
Our Restless Spirits Yearn For Thee,
Where-E'R Our Changeful Lot Is Cast;
Glad, When Thy Gracious Smile We See,
Blest, When Our Faith Can Hold Thee Fast.

5
O Jesus, Ever With Us Stay;
Make All Our Moments Calm And Bright;
Chase The Dark Night Of Sin Away,
Shed O'R The World Thy Holy Light!
