Lord, Dismiss Us With Thy Blessing;
Fill Our Hearts With Joy And Peace;
Let Us Each, Thy Love Possessing,
Triumph In Redeeming Grace.
O Refresh Us, O Refresh Us,
Traveling Through This Wilderness.

Thanks We Give And Adoration
For Thy Gospel'S Joyful Sound.
May The Fruits Of Thy Salvation
In Our Hearts And Lives Abound;
Ever Faithful, Ever Faithful
To The Truth May We Be Found.
