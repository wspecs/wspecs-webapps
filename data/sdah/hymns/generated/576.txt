576 - Awake, Awake To Love And Work


1
Awake, Awake To Love And Work!
The Lark Is In The Sky;
The Fields Are Wet With Diamond Dew;
The Worlds Awake To Cry
Their Blessings On The Lord Of Life,
As He Goes Meekly By.

2
Come, Let Thy Voice Be One With Theirs,
Shout With Their Shout Of Praise;
See How The Giant Sun Soars Up,
Great Lord Of Years And Days!
So Let The Love Of Jesus Come
And Set Thy Soul Ablaze.

3
To Give And Give, And Give Again,
What God Hath Given Thee;
To Spend Thyself Nor Count The Cost;
To Serve Right Gloriously
The God Who Gave All Worlds That Are,
And All That Are To Be.
