160 - Ride On In Majesty


1
Ride On! Ride On In Majesty!
Hark, All The Tribes Hosanna Cry;
O Savior Meek, Pursue Thy Road
With Palms And Scattered Garments Strowed.

2
Ride On! Ride On In Majesty!
In Lowly Pomp Ride On To Die;
O Christ, Thy Triumphs Now Begin
O'Er Captive Death And Conquered Sin.

3
Ride On! Ride On In Majesty!
The Winged Squadrons Of The Sky
Look Down With Sad And Wondering Eyes
To See The Approaching Sacrifice.

4
Ride On! Ride On In Majesty!
In Lowly Pomp Ride On To Die;
Bow Thy Meek Head To Mortal Pain,
Then Take, O God, Thy Power And Reign.
