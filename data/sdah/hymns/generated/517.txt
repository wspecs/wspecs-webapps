517 - My Faith Looks Up To Thee


1
My Faith Looks Up To Thee,
Thou Lamb Of Calvary,
Savior Divine;
Now Hear Me While I Pray,
Take All My Guilt Away,
O Let Me From This Day
Be Wholly Thine.

2
May Thy Rich Grace Impart
Strength To My Fainting Heart,
My Zeal Inspire!
As Thou Hast Died For Me,
O May My Love To Thee
Pure, Warm, And Changeless Be,
A Living Fire!

3
While Life'S Dark Maze I Tread,
And Griefs Around Me Spread,
Be Thou My Guide;
Bid Darkness Turn To Day,
Wipe Sorrow'S Tears Away,
Nor Let Me Ever Stray
From Thee Aside.
