479 - Tread Softly


1
Be Silent, Be Silent, A Whisper Is Heard;
Be Silent, And Listen, Oh Treasure Each Word.

Refrain
Tread Softly, Tread Softly, The Master Is Here;
Tread Softly Here, Tread Softly Here,
Tread Softly, Tread Softly, He Bids Us Draw Near.
Tread Softly Here, Tread Softly Here,

2
Be Silent, Be Silent, For Holy This Place,
This Altar That Echoes The Message Of Grace.

3
Be Silent, Be Silent, Breathe Humbly Our Prayer;
A Foretaste Of Eden This Moment We Share.

4
Be Silent, Be Silent, His Mercy Record;
Be Silent, Be Silent, And Wait On The Lord.
