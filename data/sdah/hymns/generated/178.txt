178 - The Unveiled Christ


1
Once Our Blessed Christ Of Beauty
Was Veiled Off From Human Views;
But Through Suffering, Death, And Sorrow
He Has Rent The Veil In Two.

Refrain
O Behold The Man Of Sorrows!
O Behold Him In Plain View!
Lo! He Is The Mighty Conqueror
Since Her Rent The Veil In Two;
Lo! He Is The Mighty Conqueror
Since Her Rent The Veil In Two.

2
Yes, He Is With God, The Father,
Interceding There For You;
For He Is The Well Beloved
Since He Rent The Veil In Two.

3
Holy Angels Bow Before Him,
Men Of Earth Give Praises Due;
For He Is The Mighty Conqueror
Since He Rent The Veil In Two.
