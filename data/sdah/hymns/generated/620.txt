620 - On Jordan'S Stormy Banks


1
On Jordan'S Stormy Banks I Stand,
And Cast A Wishful Eye
To Canaan'S Fair And Happy Land,
Where My Possessions Lie.
I Am Bound For The Promised Land,
I Am Bound For The Promised Land;
O Who Will Come And Go With Me?
I Am Bound For The Promised Land.

2
O'Er All Those Wide Extended Plain
Shines One Eternal Day;
There, Christ, The Sun, For Ever Reigns,
And Scatters Night Away.
I Am Bound For The Promised Land,
I Am Bound For The Promised Land;
O Who Will Come And Go With Me?
I Am Bound For The Promised Land.

3
When Shall I Reach That Happy Place,
And Be Forever Blest?
When Shall I See My Father'S Face,
And In His Kingdom Rest?
I Am Bound For The Promised Land,
I Am Bound For The Promised Land;
O Who Will Come And Go With Me?
I Am Bound For The Promised Land.

4
Filled With Delight, My Raptured Soul
Would Here No Longer Stay;
Though Jordan'S Waves Around Me Roll,
Fearless I'D Launch Away.
I Am Bound For The Promised Land,
I Am Bound For The Promised Land;
O Who Will Come And Go With Me?
I Am Bound For The Promised Land.
