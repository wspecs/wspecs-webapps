179 - The Wonders Of Redeeming Love


1
The Wonders Of Redeeming Love
Our Highest Thoughts Exceed;
The Son Of God Comes From Above
For Sinful Man To Bleed.

2
He Gives Himself, His Life, His All,
A Sinless Sacrifice.
For Man He Drains The Cup Of Gall,
For Man The Victim Dies.

3
And Now Before His Father'S Face
His Precious Blood He Pleads;
For Those Who Seek The Throne Of Grace
His Love Still Intercedes.

4
He Knows The Frailties Of Our Frame,
For He Has Borne Our Grief;
Our Great High Priest Once Felt The Same,
And He Can Send Relief.

5
His Love Will Not Be Satisfied,
Till He In Glory Sees
The Faithful Ones For Whom He Died
From Sin Forever Free.
