648 - I Vow To Thee, My Country


1
I Vow To Thee, My Country,
All Earthly Things Above,
Entire And Whole And Perfect,
The Service Of My Love:
The Love That Asks The Reason,
The Love That Stands The Test,
That Lays Upon The Altar
The Dearest And The Best;
The Love That Never Falters,
The Love That Pays The Price,
The Love That Makes Undaunted
The Final Sacrifice.

2
And There'S Another Country,
I'Ve Heard Of Long Ago,
Most Dear To Them That Love Her,
Most Great To Them That Know;
We May Not Count Her Armies,
We May Not See Her King;
Her Fortress Is A Faithful Heart,
Her Pride Is Suffering;
And One By One And Fervently
We Pray For Her Increase,
And Her Ways Are Ways Of Gentleness,
And All Her Paths Are Peace.
