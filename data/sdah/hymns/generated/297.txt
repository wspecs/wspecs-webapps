297 - God Be Merciful To Me


1
God, Be Merciful To Me,
On Thy Grace I Rest My Plea;
Plenteous In Compassion Thou,
Blot Out My Transgressions Now;
Wash Me, Make Me Pure Within,
Cleanse, O Cleanse Me From My Sin,
Wash Me, Make Me Pure Within,
Cleanse, O Cleanse Me From My Sin.

2
I Am Evil, Born In Sin;
Thou Desirest Truth Within.
Thou Alone My Savior Art,
Teach Thy Wisdom To My Heart;
Make Me Pure, Thy Grace Bestow,
Wash Me Whiter Than The Snow,
Make Me Pure, Thy Grace Bestow,
Wash Me Whiter Than The Snow.

3
Gracious God, My Heart Renew,
Make My Spirit Right And True;
Cast Me Not Away From Thee,
Let Thy Spirit Dwell In Me;
Thy Salvation'S Joy Impart,
Steadfast Make My Willing Heart,
Thy Salvation'S Joy Impart,
Steadfast Make My Willing Heart.

4
Sinners Then Shall Learn From Me
And Return, O God, To Thee;
Savior, All My Guilt Remove,
And My Tongue Shall Sing Thy Love;
Touch My Silent Lips, O Lord,
And My Mouth Shall Praise Accord,
Touch My Silent Lips, O Lord,
And My Mouth Shall Praise Accord.
