424 - For Thee, O Dear, Dear Country


1
For Thee, O Dear Country,
Mine Eyes Their Vigils Keep;
For Very Love Beholding
Thy Holy Name, They Weep.

2
O One, O Only Mansion!
O Paradise Of Joy!
Where Tears Are Ever Banish'D
And Smiles Have No Alloy;

3
With Jasper Glow Thy Burwarks,
Thy Streets With Emeralds Blaze;
The Sardius And The Topaz
Unite In Thee Their Rays;

4
The Cross Is All Thy Splendor,
The Crucified Thy Praise;
His Laud And Benediction
Thy Ransom'D Saints Shall Raise;

5
O Sweet And Blessed Country,
The Home Of God'S Elect!
O Sweet And Blessed Country
That Eager Hearts Expect!
