585 - When Christ Was Lifted From The Earth


1
When Christ Was Lifted From The Earth
His Arms Stretched Out Above
Through Every Culture, Every Birth,
To Draw An Answering Love.

2
Still East And West His Love Extends
And Always, Near Or Far,
He Calls And Claims Us As His Friends
And Loves Us As We Are.

3
Where Generation, Class, Or Race
Divides Us To Our Shame,
He Sees Not Labels But A Face,
A Person And A Name.

4
Thus Freely Loved, Tho' Fully Known,
May I In Christ Be Free
To Welcome And Accept His Own
As Christ Accepted Me.
