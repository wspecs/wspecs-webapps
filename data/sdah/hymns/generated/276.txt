276 - Thanks To God

Thanks To God Whose Word Was Spoken
In The Deed That Made The Earth.
His The Voice That Called A Nation;
His The Fires That Tried Her Worth.
God Has Spoken;
Praise Him For His Open Word

2
Thanks To God Whose Word Incarnate
Glorified The Flesh Of Man.
Deeds And Words And Death And Rising
Tell The Grace In Heaven'S Plan.
God Has Spoken;
Praise Him For His Open Word

3
Thanks To God Whose Word Is Answered
By The Spirit'S Voice Within.
Here We Drink Of Joy Unmeasured,
Life Redeemed From Death And Sin.
God Has Spoken;
Praise Him For His Open Word
