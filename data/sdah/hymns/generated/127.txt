127 - Infant Holy, Infant Lowly


1
Infant Holy, Infant Lowly,
For His Bed A Cattle Stall;
Oxen Lowing, Little Knowing
Christ The Babe Is Lord Of All;
Swift Are Winging Angels Singing,
Noels Ringing, Tidings Bringing,
Christ The Babe Is Lord Of All,
Christ The Babe Is Lord Of All.

2
Flocks Were Sleeping, Shepherds Keeping
Vigil Till The Morning New;
Saw The Glory, Heard The Story,
Tidings Of The Gospel True;
Thus Rejoicing, Free From Sorrow,
Praises Voicing Greet The Morrow,
Christ The Babe Was Born For You,
Christ The Babe Was Born For You.
