621 - Gracious Father, Guard Thy Children


1
Gracious Father, Guard Thy Children
From The Foe'S Destructive Power;
Save, O Save Them, Lord, From Falling
In This Dark And Trying Hour.
Thou Wilt Surely Prove Thy People,
All Our Graces Must Be Tried;
But Thy Word Illumes Our Pathway,
And In God We Still Confide.

2
We Are In The Time Of Waiting;
Soon We Shall Behold Our Lord,
Wafted Far Away From Sorrow,
To Receive Our Rich Reward.
Keep Us, Lord, Till Thine Appearing,
Pure, Unspotted From The World;
Let Thy Holy Spirit Cheer Us
Till Thy Banner Is Unfurled.

3
With What Joyful Exultation
Shall The Saints Thy Banner See,
When The Lord For Whom We'Ve Waited
Shall Proclaim The Jubilee!
Freedom From This World'S Pollutions;
Freedom From All Sin And Pain;
Freedom From The Wiles Of Satan,
And From Death'S Destructive Reign.
