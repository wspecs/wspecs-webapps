111 - It Took A Miracle


1
My Father Is Omnipotent
And That You Can'T Deny;
A God Of Might And Miracles;
'Tis Written In The Sky.

Refrain
It Took A Miracle To Put The Stars In Place;
It Took A Miracle To Hang The World In Space.
But When He Saved My Soul,
Cleansed And Made Me Whole,
It Took A Miracle Of Love And Grace!

2
Though Here His Glory Has Been Shown,
We Still Can'T Fully See
The Wonders Of His Might, His Throne;
'Till Eternity.

3
The Bible Tells Us Of His Power
And Wisdom All Way Through;
And Every Little Bird And Flower
Are Testimonies, Too.
