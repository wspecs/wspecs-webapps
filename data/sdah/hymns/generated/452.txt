452 - What Heavenly Music


1
What Heavenly Music Steals Over The Sea!
Entrancing The Senses Like Sweet Melody!
'Tis The Voice Of The Angels Borne Soft On The Air;
For Me They Are Singing; Their Welcome I Hear.

2
On The Banks Of Old Jordan, Here Gazing I Stand,
And Earnestly Longing, I Stretch Forth My Hand;
Send A Convoy Of Angels, Dear Jesus, I Pray!
Let Me Join That Sweet Music; Come, Take Me Away.

3
Though Dark Are The Waters And Rough Is The Wave,
If Jesus Permit, The Wild Surges I'Ll Brave;
For That Heavenly Music Hath Ravished Me So,
I Must Join In That Chorus! I'Ll Go! Let Me Go!
