131 - Lo, How A Rose E'Er Blooming


1
Lo, How A Rose E'Re Blooming
From Tenderstem Hath Sprung,
Of Jesse'S Lineage Coming
As Men Of Old Have Sung.
It Came, A Floweret Bright,
Amid The Cold Of Winter
When Half Spent Was The Night.

2
Isaiah 'Twas Foretold It,
The Rose I Have In Mind,
With Mary We Beheld It,
The Virgin Mother Kind.
To Show God'S Love Aright
She Bore To Them A Savior,
When Half Spent Was The Night.
