212 - 'Tis Almost Time For The Lord To Come


1
'Tis Almost Time For The Lord To Come,
I Hear The People Say;
The Stars Of Heaven Are Growing Dim,
It Must Be The Breaking Of The Day.

Refrain
O It Must Be The Breaking Of The Day!
O It Must Be The Breaking Of The Day!
The Night Is Almost Gone,
The Day Is Coming On;
O It Must Be The Breaking Of The Day!

2
The Signs Foretold In The Sun And Moon,
In Earth And Sea And Sky,
Aloud Proclaim To All Mankind,
The Coming Of The Master Draweth Nigh.

3
It Must Be Time For The Waiting Church
To Cast Her Pride Away,
With Girded Loins And Burning Lamps,
To Look For The Breaking Of The Day.

4
Go Quickly Out In The Streets And Lanes
And In The Broad Highway,
And Call The Maimed, The Halt, And Blind,
To Be Ready For The Breaking Of The Day.
