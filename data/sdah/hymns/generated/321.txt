321 - My Jesus, I Love Thee


1
My Jesus, I Love Thee, I Know Thou Art Mine;
For Thee All The Follies Of Sin I Resign.
My Gracious Redeemer, My Savior Art Thou;
If Ever I Loved Thee, My Jesus, 'Tis Now.

2
I Love Thee Because Thou Hast First Loved Me,
And Purchased My Pardon On Calvary'S Tree;
I Love Thee For Wearing The Thorns On Thy Brow;
If Ever I Loved Thee, My Jesus, 'Tis Now.

3
I'Ll Love Thee In Life, I Will Love Thee 'Til Death,
And Praise Thee As Long As Thou Lendest Me Breath;
And Say When The Death Dew Lies Cold On My Brow,
If Ever I Loved Thee, My Jesus, 'Tis Now.

4
In Mansions Of Glory And Endless Delight;
I'Ll Ever Adore Thee In Heaven So Bright;
I'Ll Sing With The Glittering Crown On My Brow;
If Ever I Loved Thee, My Jesus, 'Tis Now.
