035 - With Songs And Honors


1
With Songs And Honors Sounding Loud,
Address The Lord On High;
Over The Heavens He Spreads His Cloud,
And Waters Veil The Sky.

2
He Sends His Showers Of Blessing Down
To Cheer The Plains Below;
He Makes The Grass The Mountains Crown,
And Corning Valleys Grow.

3
His Steady Counsels Change The Face
Of The Declining Year;
He Bids The Sun Cut Short His Race,
And Wintry Days Appear.

4
He Sends His Word, And Melts The Snow;
The Fields No Longer Mourn;
He Calls The Warmer Gales To Blow,
And Bids The Spring Return.

5
The Changing Wind, The Flying Cloud,
Obey His Mighty Word:
With Songs And Honors Sounding Loud
Praise Ye The Sovereign Lord!
