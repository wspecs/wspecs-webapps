033 - Sing A New Song To The Lord


1
Sing A New Song To The Lord,
He To Whom Wonders Belong.
Rejoice In His Triumph And Tell Of His Power.
O Sing A New Song To The Lord.

2
Now To The Ends Of The Earth
See His Salvation Is Shown.
And Still He Remembers His Mercy And Truth,
Unchanging In Love To His Own.

3
Sing A New Song And Rejoice.
Publish His Praises Abroad.
Let Voices In Chorus With Trumpet And Horn,
Resound For The Joy Of The Lord.

4
Join With The Hills And The Sea,
Thunders Of Praise To Prolong.
In Judgement And Justice
He Comes To The Earth
O Sing A New Song To The Lord.
