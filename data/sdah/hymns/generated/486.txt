486 - I Do Believe


1
Father, I Stretch My Hands To Thee;
No Other Help I Know;
If Thou Withdraw Thyself From Me,
Ah, Wither Shall I Go?

2
On Thy Dear Son I Now Believe,
O Let Me Feel Thy Power;
And All My Varied Wants Relieve,
In This Accepted Hour.

3
Author Of Faith! To Thee I Lift
My Weary, Longing Eyes;
O Let Me Now Receive That Gift;
My Soul Without It Dies.

4
Surely Thou Canst Not Let Me Die;
O Speak, And I Shall Live;
And Here I Will Unwearied Lie,
Till Thou Thy Spirit Give.

5
How Would My Fainting Soul Rejoice
Could I But See Thy Face!
Now Let Me Hear Thy Quickening Voice,
And Taste Thy Pardoning Grace.

6
I Do Believe, I Now Believe
That Jesus Died For Me,
And That He Shed His Precious Blood
From Sin To Set Me Free.
