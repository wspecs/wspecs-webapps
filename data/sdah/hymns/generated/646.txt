646 - To The Name That Brings Salvation


1
To The Name That Brings Salvation
Let The Nations Bow The Head;
Let Them Kneel In Adoration
When This Name Of Names Is Said;
Let Them Pray For Restoration
Of All Things In Christ The Head.

2
He Through Every Generation
Rules In Endless Majesty;
May The Kings Of Every Nation
Now Foreswear Their Enmity,
And With Humble Veneration
In The Love Of God Agree.

3
Lord, We Pray For Upright Rulers:
Guard Them Surely In Their Need
From The Vanity Of Power
And The Emptiness Of Greed;
Let Them See The Truth Of Lowness,
And On Justice Let Them Feed.
