250 - O For A Thousand Tongues To Sing


1
O For A Thousand Tongues To Sing
My Great Redeemer'S Praise,
The Glories Of My God And King,
The Triumphs Of His Grace!

2
My Gracious Master And My God,
Assist Me To Proclaim,
To Spread Through All The Earth Abroad
The Honors Of Thy Name.

3
Jesus! The Name That Charms Our Fears,
That Bids Our Sorrows Cease;
'Tis Music In The Sinner'S Ears,
'Tis Life, And Health, And Peace.

4
He Breaks The Power Of Canceled Sin,
He Sets The Prisoner Free;
His Blood Can Make The Foulest Clean;
His Blood Availed For Me.

5
He Speaks, And Listening To His Voice,
New Life The Dead Receive;
The Mournful, Broken Hearts Rejoice,
The Humble Poor Believe.

6
Hear Him, Ye Deaf; His Praise, Ye Dumb,
Your Loosened Tongues Employ;
Ye Blind, Behold Your Savior Come,
And Leap, Ye Lame, For Joy.
