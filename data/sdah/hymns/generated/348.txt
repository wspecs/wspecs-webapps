348 - The Church Has One Foundation


1
The Church'S One Foundation
Is Jesus Christ Her Lord;
She Is His New Creation
By Water And The Word.
From Heaven He Came And Sought Her
To Be His Holy Bride;
With His Own Blood He Bought Her,
And For Her Life He Died.

2
Elect From Every Nation,
Yet One O'Er All The Earth;
Her Charter Of Salvation,
One Lord, One Faith, One Birth;
One Holy Name She Blesses,
Partakes One Holy Food,
And To One Hope She Presses,
With Every Grace Endued.

3
Though With A Scornful Wonder
We See Her Sore Oppressed,
By Schisms Rent Asunder,
By Heresies Distressed,
Yet Saints Their Watch Are Keeping;
Their Cry Goes Up, "How Long?"
And Soon The Night Of Weeping
Shall Be The Morn Of Song.

4
'Mid Toil And Tribulation,
And Tumult Of Her War,
She Waits The Consummation
Of Peace Forevermore;
Till, With The Vision Glorious,
Her Longing Eyes Are Blest,
And The Great Church Victorious
Shall Be The Church At Rest.
