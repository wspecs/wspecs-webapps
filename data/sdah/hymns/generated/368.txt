368 - Watchman, Blow The Gospel Trumpet


1
Watchman, Blow The Gospel Trumpet,
Every Soul A Warning Give;
Whosoever Hears The Message
May Repent, And, Turn And Live.

Refrain
Blow The Trumpet, Trusty Watchman,
Blow It Loud O'Er Land And Sea;
God Commissions, Sound The Message!
Every Captive May Be Free.

2
Sound It Loud OÃ©R Every Hilltop,
Gloomy Shade And Sunny Plain;
Ocean Depths Repeat The Message,
Full Salvation'S Glad Refrain.

3
Sound It In The Hedge And Highway,
Earth'S Dark Spots Where Exiles Roam;
Let It Tell All Things Are Ready,
Father Waits To Welcome Home.

4
Sound It For The Heavy Laden,
Weary, Longing To Be Free;
Sound A Savior'S Invitation,
Sweetly Saying, "Come To Me."
