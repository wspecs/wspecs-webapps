642 - We Praise Thee With Our Minds


1
We Praise Thee With Our Minds,
O Lordkept Sharp Think Thy Thought;Come,
Holy Ghost With Grace Outpoured,
To Teach What Christ Hath Taught.
In All Our Learning May We Seek
That Wisdom From Above
Which Comes To All: The Brave,
The Meekwho Ask In Faith And Love.

2
We Praise Thee Thro' Our Bodies,
Lord,Kept Strong To Do Thy Will;
Thy Spirit'S Temples, Which Afford
A Means To Praise Thee Still.
We Give Ourselves, A Sacrifice,
To Live As Unto Thee;
For Thou Alone Hast Paid The Price
To Bring Salvation Free.

3
We Praise Thee In Our Hearts,
O King,Kept Pure To Know Thy Ways;
And Raise To Thee A Hymn To Sing
Eternally Thy Praise.
Altho Adoring Hearts Will Bow
As Age On Ages Roll;
We Praise Thee In Our Beings Now,
Mind, Body, Heart, And Soul.
