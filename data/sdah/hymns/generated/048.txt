048 - Softly Now The Light Of Day


1
Softly Now The Light Of Day
Fades Upon Out Sight Away:
Free From Care, From Labor Free,
Lord, We Would Commune With Thee.

2
Thou, Whose Allpervading Eye
Nought Escapes, Without, Within,
Pardon Each Infirmity,
Open Fault, And Secret Sin.

3
Soon From Us The Light Of Day
Shall Forever Pass Away;
Then, From Sin And Sorrow Free,
Take Us, Lord, To Dwell With Thee.
