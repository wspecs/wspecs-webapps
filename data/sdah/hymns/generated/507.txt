507 - Moment By Moment


1
Dying With Jesus, By Death Reckoned Mine,
Living With Jesus, A New Life Divine,
Looking To Jesus Till Glory Doth Shine,
Moment By Moment, O Lord, I Am Thine.

Refrain
Moment By Moment I'M Kept In His Love;
Moment By Moment I'Ve Life From Above;
Looking To Jesus Till Glory Doth Shine;
Moment By Moment, O Lord, I Am Thine.

2
Never A Trial That He Is Not There,
Never A Burden That He Doth Not Bear,
Never A Sorrow That He Doth Not Share,
Moment By Moment I'M Under His Care.

3
Never A Heart-Ache, And Never A Groan,
Never A Teardrop And Never A Moan;
Never A Danger But There On Teh Throne,
Moment By Moment He Thinks Of His Own.

4
Never A Weakness That He Doth Not Feel,
Never A Sickness That He Cannot Heal;
Moment By Moment, In Woe Or In Weal,
Jesus, My Savior, Abides With Me Still.
