397 - An Upper Room


1
An Upper Room Did Our Lord Prepare
For Those Loved Until The End:
And His Disciples Still Gather There,
To Celebrate Their Risen Friend.

2
And After Supper He Washed Their Feet,
For Service, Too, Is Sacrament.
In Him Our Joy Shall Be Made Complete
Sent Out To Serve, As He Was Sent.

3
A Lasting Gift Jesus Gave His Own:
To Share His Bread, His Loving Cup.
Whatever Burdens May Bow Us Down,
He By His Cross Shall Lift Us Up.

4
No End There Is! We Depart In Peace.
He Loves Beyond Our Uttermost:
In Every Room In Our Father'S House,
He Will Be There, As Lord And Host.
