614 - Sound The Battle Cry


1
Sound The Battle Cry,
See! The Foe Is Nigh;
Raise The Standard High
For The Lord;
Gird Your Armor On,
Stand Firm, Every One,
Rest Your Cause Upon His Holy Word.

Refrain
Rouse, Then Soldiers!
Rally Round The Banner!
Ready, Steady, Pass The Word Along;
Onward, Forward, Shout Aloud Hosanna!
Christ Is Captain Of The Mighty Throng.

2
Strong To Meet The Foe,
Marching On We Go,
While Our Cause We Know
Must Prevail;
Shield And Banner Bright,
Gleaming In The Light,
Battling For The Right,
We Ne'Er Can Fail.

3
O Thou God Of All,
Hear Us When We Call,
Help Us, One And All,
By Thy Grace;
When The Battle'S Done,
And The Victory Won,
May We Wear The Crown
Before Thy Face.
