355 - Where Cross The Crowded Ways Of Life


1
Where Cross The Crowded Ways Of Life,
Where Sound The Cries Of Race And Clan,
Above The Noise Of Selfish Strife,
We Hear Your Voice, O Son Of Man.

2
From Tender Childhood'S Helplessness,
From Woman'S Grief, Man'S Burdened Toil,
From Famished Souls, From Sorrow'S Stress,
Your Heart Has Never Known Recoil.

3
The Cup Of Water Given For You Still
Holds The Freshness Of Your Grace;
Yet Long These Multitudes To View
The Sweet Compassion Of Your Face.

4
O Master, From The Mountainside
Make Haste To Heal These Hearts Of Pain;
Among These Restless Throngs Abide;
O Tread The City'S Streets Again.

5
Till All The World Shall Learn Your Love
And Follow Where Your Feet Have Trod,
Till, Glorious From Your Heaven Above,
Shall Come The City Of Our God.
