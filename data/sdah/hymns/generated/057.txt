057 - Now All The Woods Are Sleeping


1
Now All The Woods Are Sleeping,
And Night And Stillness Creeping
O'Er City, Man, And Beast;
But Thou, My Heart, Awake Thee,
To Pray'R Awhile Be Take Thee,
And Praise Thy Maker Ere Thou Rest.

2
My Jesus, Stay Thou By Me,
And Let No Foe Come Nigh Me,
Safe Sheltered By Thy Wing;
But Would The Foe Alarm Me,
O Let Him Never Harm Me,
But Still Thine Angels Round Me Sing!

3
My Loved Ones, Rest Securely,
From Every Peril Surely
Our God Will Guard Your Heads;
And Happy Slumbers Send You,
And Bid His Hosts Attend You,
And Golden Armed Watch O'Er Your Beds.
