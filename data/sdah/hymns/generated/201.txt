201 - Christ Is Coming


1
Christ Is Coming! Let Creation
Bid Her Groans And Travail Cease;
Let The Glorious Proclamation
Hope Restore And Faith Increase;
Christ Is Coming! Christ Is Coming!
Come, Thou Blessed Prince Of Peace!
(Prince Of Peace!)
Come, Thou Blessed Prince Of Peace!

2
Earth Can Now But Tell The Story
Of Thy Bitter Cross And Pain;
She Shall Yet Behold Thy Glory
When Thou Comest Back To Reign;
Christ Is Coming! Christ Is Coming!
Let Each Heart Repeat The Strain.
(Repeat The Strain)
Let Each Heart Repeat The Strain.

3
With That "Blessed Hope" Before Us,
Let No Harp Remain Unstrung;
Let The Mighty Advent Chorus
Onward Roll From Tongue To Tongue:
Christ Is Coming! Christ Is Coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, Quickly Come!
(Quickly Come!)
Come, Lord Jesus, Quickly Come!
