194 - Sing We Of The Modern City


1
Sing We Of The Modern City,
Scene Alike Of Joy And Stress;
Sing We Of Its Nameless People
In Their Urban Wilderness.
Into Endless Rows Of Houses
Life Is Set A Millionfold,
Life Expressed In Human Beings
Daily Born And Growing Old.

2
In The City Full Of People,
World Of Speed And Hectic Days,
In The Ever-Changing Setting
Of The Latest Trend And Craze,
Christ Is Present, And Among Us;
In The Crowd We See Him Stand.
In The Bustle Of The City
Jesus Christ Is Every Man.

3
God Is Not Remote In Heaven,
But On Earth To Share Our Shame,
Changing Graph And Mass And Number
Into Persons With A Name.
Christ Has Shown, Beyond Statistics,
Human Life With Glory Crowned,
By His Timeless Presence Proving
People Matter, People Count!
