504 - Lord Jesus, Think On Me


1
Lord Jesus, Think On Me,
And Purge Away My Sin;
From Earth-Born Passions Set Me Free,
And Make Me Pure Within.

2
Lord Jesus, Think On Me,
With Care And Woe Oppressed;
Let Me Thy Loving Servant Be,
And Taste Thy Promised Rest.

3
Lord Jesus, Think On Me,
Nor Let Me Go Astray;
Through Darkness And Perplexity
Point Thou The Heavenly Way.

4
Lord Jesus, Think On Me,
That I May Sing Above
To Father, Spirit, And To Thee,
The Strains Of Praise And Love.
