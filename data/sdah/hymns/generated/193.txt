1
Saviour, Teach Me Day By Day,
Love'S Sweet Lesson To Obey,
Sweeter Lesson Cannot Be,
Loving Him Who First Loved Me.

With A Child'S Glad Heart Of Love,
At Thy Bidding May I Move,
Prompt To Serve And Follow Thee,
Loving Him Who First Loved Me.

3
Teach Me I Am Not My Own,
I Am Thine, And Thine Alone;
Thine To Keep, To Rule, To Save
From All Sin That Would Enslave.

4
Love In Loving Finds Employ,
In Obedience All Her Joy;
Ever New That Joy Will Be,
Loving Him Who First Loved Me.

5
Teach Me Thus Thy Steps To Trace,
Strong To Follow In Thy Grace.
Learning How To Love From Thee,
Loving Him Who First Loved Me.
