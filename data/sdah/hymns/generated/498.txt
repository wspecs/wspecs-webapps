498 - Still, Still With Thee


1
Still, Still With Thee, When Purple Morning Breaketh,
When The Bird Waketh, And The Shadows Flee;
Fairer Than Morning, Lovelier Than Daylight,
Dawns The Sweet Consciousness, I Am With Thee.

2
Alone With Thee, Amid The Mystic Shadows,
The Solemn Hush Of Nature Newly Born;
Alone With Thee In Breathless Adoration,
In The Calm Dew And Freshness Of The Morn.

3
Still, Still With Thee! As To Each Newborn Morning
A Fresh And Solemn Splendor Still Is Given,
So Does This Blessed Consciousness, Awaking,
Breathe Each Day Nearness Unto Thee And Heaven.

4
So Shall It Be At Last, In That Bright Morning,
When The Soul Waketh And Life'S Shadows Flee;
O In That Hour, Fairer Than Daylight Dawning,
Shall Rise The Glorious Thought, I Am With Thee.
