553 - Jesus, Guide Our Way


1
Jesus, Guide Our Way
To Eternal Day:
So Shall We, No More Delaying,
Follow Thee, Thy Voice Obeying:
Lead Us By The Hand
To Our Father'S Land.

2
When We Danger Meet
Steadfast Make Our Feet;
Lord, Preserve Us Uncomplaining
Mid The Darkness Round Us Reigning:
Through Adversity Lies Our Way To Thee.

3
Order All Our Way
Through The Mortal Day:
In Our Toil, With Aid Be Near Us:
In Our Need, With Succour Cheer Us:
Till We Safely Stand
In Our Father'S Land.
