643 - Father, Who On Us Do Shower


1
Father, Who On Us Do Shower
Gifts Of Plenty Form Your Dower,
To Your People Give The Power
All Your Gifts To Use Aright.

2
Give Pure Happiness In Leisure
Temperance In Every Pleasure,
Wholesome Use Of Earthly Treasure
Bodies Clean And Spirits Bright.

3
Lift From This And Every Nation
All That Brings Us Degradation;
Quell The Forces Of Temptation;
Put Your Enemies To Flight.

4
Father, You Who Sought And Found Us,
Son Of God, Whose Love Has Bound Us,
Holy Spirit, In Us, Round Us,
Hear Us, Godhead Infinite.
