091 - Ye Watchers And Ye Holy Ones


1
Ye Watchers And Ye Holy Ones,
Bright Seraphs, Cherubim And Thrones,
Raise The Glad Strain, Alleluia!
Cry Out, Dominions, Princedoms, Powers,
Virtues, Archangels, Angels' Choirs:

Refrain
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia!

2
O Higher Than The Cherubim,
More Glorious Than The Seraphim,
Lead Their Praises, Alleluia!
Thou Bearer Of Th'Eternal Word,
Most Gracious, Magnify The Lord.

3
O Friends, In Gladness Let Us Sing,
Supernal Anthems Echoing,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
To God The Father, God The Son,
And God The Spirit, Three In One.
