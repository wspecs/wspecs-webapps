345 - Christ Is The World'S True Light


1
Christ Is The World'S True Light,
Its Captain Of Salvation,
The Daystar Clear And Bright
Of Every Man And Nation;
New Life, New Hope Awakes
Where'Er Men Own His Sway:
Freedom Her Bondage Breaks,
And Night Is Turned To Day.

2
In Christ All Races Meet,
Their Ancient Feuds Forgeting,
The Whole Round World Complete,
From Sunrise To Its Setting:
When Christ Is Throned As Lord,
Men Shall Forsake Their Fear,
To Plowshare Beat The Sword,
To Pruning Hook The Spear.

3
One Lord, In One Great Name
Unite Us All Who Own Thee,
Cast Out Our Pride And Shame
That Hinder To Enthrone Thee;
The World Has Waited Long,
Has Travailed Long In Pain,
To Heal Its Ancient Wrong,
Come, Prince Of Peace, And Reign.
