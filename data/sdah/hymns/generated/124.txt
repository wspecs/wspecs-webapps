124 - Away In A Manger


1
Away In A Manger, No Crib For A Bed,
The Little Lord Jesus Laid Down His Sweet Head.
The Stars In The Sky Looked Down Where He Lay,
The Little Lord Jesus Asleep In The Hay.

2
The Cattle Are Lowing, The Baby Awakes,
But Little Lord Jesus No Crying He Makes.
I Love Thee, Lord Jesus, Look Down From The Sky
And Stay By My Cradle Til Morning Is Nigh.

3
Be Near Me, Lord Jesus, I Ask Thee To Stay
Close By Me Forever, And Love Me, I Pray.
Bless All The Dear Children In Thy Tender Care,
And Take Us To Heaven, To Live With Thee There.
