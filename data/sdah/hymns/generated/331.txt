331 - O Jesus, I Have Promised


1
O Jesus, I Have Promised
To Serve Thee To The End;
Be Thou Forever Near Me,
My Master And My Friend.
I Shall Not Fear The Battle
If Thou Art By My Side,
Nor Wander From The Pathway
If Thou Wilt Be My Guide.

2
O Let Me Feel Thee Near Me!
The World Is Ever Near;
I See The Sights That Dazzle,
The Tempting Sounds I Hear;
My Foes Are Ever Near Me,
Around Me And Within;
But Jesus, Draw Thou Nearer,
And Shield My Soul From Sin.

3
O Jesus, Thou Hast Promised
To All Who Follow Thee
That Where Thou Art In Glory
There Shall Thy Servant Be.
And Jesus, I Have Promised
To Serve Thee To The End;
O Give Me Grace To Follow,
My Master And My Friend.
