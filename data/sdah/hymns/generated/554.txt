554 - O Let Me Walk With Thee


1
O Let Me Walk With Thee, My God,
As Enoch Walked In Days Of Old;
Place Thou My Trembling Hand In Thine,
And Sweet Communion With Me Hold;
E'En Though The Path I May Not See,
Yet, Jesus, Let Me Walk With Thee.

2
I Cannot, Dare Not, Walk Alone;
The Tempest Rages In The Sky,
A Thousand Snares Beset My Feet,
A Thousand Foes Are Lurking Nigh.
Still Thou The Raging Of The Sea,
O Master! Let Me Walk With Thee.

3
If I May Rest My Hand In Thine,
I'Ll Count The Joys Of Earth But Loss,
And Firmly, Bravely Journey On;
I'Ll Bear The Banner Of The Cross
Till Zion'S Glorious Gates I See;
Yet, Savior, Let Me Walk With Thee.
