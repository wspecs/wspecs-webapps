574 - O Master, Let Me Walk With Thee


1
O Master, Let Me Walk With Thee
In Lowly Paths Of Service Free;
Tell Me Thy Secret; Help Me Bear
The Strain Of Toil, The Fret Of Care.

2
Help Me The Slow Of Heart To Move
By Some Clear, Winning Word Of Love;
Teach Me The Wayward Feet To Stay,
And Guide Them In The Homeward Way.

3
Teach Me Thy Patience; Still With Thee
In Closer, Dearer Company,
In Work That Keeps Faith Sweet And Strong,
In Trust That Triumphs Over Wrong;

4
In Hope That Sends A Shining Ray
Far Down The Future'S Broadening Way,
In Peace That Only Thou Canst Give,
With Thee, O Master, Let Me Live.
