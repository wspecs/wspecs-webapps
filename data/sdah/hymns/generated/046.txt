046 - Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide


1
Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide!
The Day Is Past And Gone;
The Shadows Of The Evening Fall;
The Night Is Coming On!
Within My Heart A Welcome Guest,
Within My Home Abide;

Refrain
O Savior, Stay This Night With Me;
Behold, 'Tis Eventide!
O Savior, Stay This Night With Me;
Behold, 'Tis Eventide.

2
Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide!
Thy Walk Today With Me
Has Made My Heart Within Me Burn,
As I Communed With Thee.
Thy Earnest Words Have Filled My Soul
And Kept Me Near Thy Side;

3
Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide!
And Lone Will Be The Night,
If I Cannot Commune With Thee,
Nor Find In Thee My Light.
The Darkness Of The World, I Fear,
Would In My Home Abide;
