410 - Thy Broken Body, Gracious Lord


1
Thy Broken Body, Gracious Lord,
Is Shadowed By This Broken Bread;
The Wine Which In This Cup Is Poured,
Points To The Blood Which Thou Hast Shed.

2
And While We Meet Together Thus,
We Show That We Are One In Thee;
Thy Precious Blood Was Shed For Us,
Thy Death, O Lord, Hast Set Us Free!

3
We Have One Hope That Thou Wilt Come,
Thee In The Air We Wait To See;
When Thou Wilt Give Thy Saints A Home,
And We Shall Ever Reign With Thee.
