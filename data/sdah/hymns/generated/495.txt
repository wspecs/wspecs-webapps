There Is A Place Of Quiet Rest,
Near To The Heart Of God;
A Place Where Sin Cannot Molest,
Near To The Heart Of God.

Refrain
O Jesus, Blest Redeemer,
Sent From The Heart Of God,
Hold Us Who Wait Before Thee
Near To The Heart Of God.

There Is A Place Of Comfort Sweet,
Near To The Heart Of God;
A Place Where We Our Savior Meet,
Near To The Heart Of God.

There Is Place A Place Of Full Release,
Near To The Heart Of God;
A Place Where All Is Joy And Peace,
Near To The Heart Of God.
