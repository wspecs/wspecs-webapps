372 - How Beauteous Are Their Feet


1
How Beauteous Are Their Feet
Who Stand On Zion'S Hill;
Who Bring Salvation On Their Tongues,
And Words Of Peace Reveal!

2
How Charming Is Their Voice,
So Sweet The Tidings Are:
"Zion, Behold Thy Savior King;
He Reigns And Triumphs Here!"

3
How Happy Are Our Ears,
That Hear The Joyful Sound
Which Kings And Prophets Waited For,
And Sought, But Never Found!

4
How Blessed Are Our Eyes,
That See This Heavenly Light;
Prophets And Kings Desired It Long,
But Died Without The Sight!

5
The Watchmen Join Their Voice,
And Tuneful Notes Employ;
Jerusalem Breaks Forth In Songs,
And Deserts Learn The Joy.
