299 - Forgive Our Sins As We Forgive


1
"Forgive Our Sins As We Forgive,"
You Taught Us, Lord, To Pray;
But You Alone Can Grant Us Grace
To Live The Words We Say.

2
How Can Your Pardon Reach And Bless
The Unforgiving Heart
That Broods On Wrongs And Will Not Let
Old Bitterness Depart?

3
In Blazing Light Your Cross Reveals
The Truth We Dimly Knew:
How Trifling Others' Debts To Us;
How Great Our Debt To You!

4
Lord, Cleanse The Depths Within Our Souls
And Bid Resentment Cease;
Then, By Your Mercy Reconciled,
Our Lives Will Spread Your Peace.
