243 - King Of Glory, King Of Peace


1
King Of Glory, King Of Peace, I Will Love Thee;
And That Love May Never Cease, I Will Move Thee.
Thou Hast Granted My Request, Thou Hast Heard Me;
Thou Didst Note My Working Breast, Thou Hast Spared Me.

2
Wherefore With My Utmost Art I Will Sing Thee,
And The Cream Of All My Heart I Will Bring Thee.
Though My Sins Against Me Cried, Thou Didst Clear Me;
And Alone, When They Replied, Thou Didst Hear Me.

3
Seven Whole Days, Not One In Seven, I Will Praise Thee;
In My Heart, Though Not In Heav'N I Can Raise Thee.
Small It Is, In This Poor Sort To Enroll Thee:
Ev'N Eternity'S Too Short To Extol Thee.
