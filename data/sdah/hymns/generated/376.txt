376 - All Things Are Thine


1
All Things Are Thine; No Gift Have We,
Lord Of All Gifts, To Offer Thee;
And Hence With Grateful Hearts Today,
Thine Own Before Thy Feet We Lay.

2
Thy Will Was In The Builder'S Thought;
Thy Hand Unseen Amidst Us Wrought;
Thro' Mortal Motive, Scheme And Plan,
Thy Wise, Eternal Purpose Ran.

3
No Lack Thy Perfect Fullness Knew;
For Human Needs And Longings Grew
This House Of Prayer- This Home Of Rest.
Here May Thy Saints Be Often Blessed.

4
In Weakness And In Want We Call
On Thee, For Whom The Heav'Ns Are Small;
Thy Glory Is Thy Children'S Good,
Thy Joy Thy Tender Fatherhood.

5
O Father! Deign These Walls To Bless;
Make This The Abode Of Righteousness,
And Let These Doors A Gateway Be
To Lead Us From Ourselves To Thee!
