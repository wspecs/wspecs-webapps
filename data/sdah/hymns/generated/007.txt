007 - The Lord In Zion Reigneth


1
The Lord In Zion Reigneth,
Let All The World Rejoice,
And Come Before His Throne
Of Grace With Tuneful Heart And Voice;
The Lord In Zion Reigneth,
And There His Praise Shall Ring,
To Him Shall Princes Bend The Knee
And Kings Their Glory Bring.

2
The Lord In Zion Reigneth,
And Who So Great As He?
The Depths Of Earth Are In His Hands;
He Rules The Mighty Sea.
O Crown His Name With Honor,
And Let His Standard Wave,
Till Distant Isles Beyond The Deep
Shall Own His Power To Save.

3
The Lord In Zion Reigneth,
These Hours To Him Belong;
O Enter Now His Temple Gates,
And Fill His Courts With Song;
Beneath His Royal Banner
Let Every Creature Fall,
Exalt The King Of Heaven And Earth,
And Crown Him Lord Of All.
