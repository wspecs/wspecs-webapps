581 - When The Church Of Jesus


1
When The Church Of Jesus Shuts Its Outer Door,
Lest The Roar Of Traffic Drown The Voice Of Prayer:
May Our Prayers, Lord Make Up Ten Times More Aware
That The World We Banish Is Our Christian Care.

2
If Our Hearts Are Lifted Where Devotion Soars
High Above This Hungry Suffering World Of Ours:
Lest Our Hymns Should Drug Us To Forget Its Needs,
Forge Our Christian Worship Into Christian Deeds.

3
Lest The Gifts We Offer, Money, Talents, Time,
Serve To Salve Our Conscience To Our Secret Shame:
Lord, Reprove, Inspire Us By The Way You Give;
Teach Us, Dying Savior, How True Christians Live.
