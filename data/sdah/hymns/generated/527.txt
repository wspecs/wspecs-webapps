527 - From Every Stormy Wind


1
From Every Stormy Wind That Blows,
From Every Swelling Tide Of Woes,
There Is A Calm, A Sure Retreat:
'Tis Found Beneath The Mercy Seat.

2
There Is A Place Where Jesus Sheds
The Oil Of Gladness On Our Heads,
A Place Than All Besides More Sweet;
It Is The Blood-Bought Mercy Seat.

3
There Is A Scene Where Spirits Blend,
Where Friend Holds Fellowship With Friend;
Though Sundered Far, By Faith They Meet
Around One Common Mercy Seat.

4
There, There, On Angel'S Wings We Soar,
And Earthly Cares Molest No More,
And Heaven Comes Down Our Souls To Greet,
And Glory Crowns The Mercy Seat.

5
Ah! Whither Should We Flee For Aid,
When Tempted, Desolate Dismayed?
Or How The Hosts Of Sin Defeat,
Had Suffering Saints No Mercy Seat?
