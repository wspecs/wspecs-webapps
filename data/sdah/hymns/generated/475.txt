475 - Balm In Gilead


1
There Is A Balm In Gilead
To Make The Wounded Whole;
There Is A Balm In Gilead
To Heal The Sin-Sick Soul.

2
Sometimes I Feel Discouraged,
And Think My Work'S In Vain,
But Then The Holy Spirit
Revives My Soul Again.

3
If You Can Not Preach Like Peter,
If You Can Not Pray Like Paul,
You Can Tell The Love Of Jesus,
And Say He Died For All.
