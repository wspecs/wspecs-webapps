579 - 'Tis Love That Makes Us Happy


1
'Tis Love That Makes Us Happy,
'Tis Love That Smooths The Way;
It Helps Us Mind, It Makes Us Kind
To Others Every Day.

Refrain
God Is Love; We'Re His Little Children.
God Is Love; We Would Be Like Him.
'Tis Love That Makes Us Happy,
'Tis Love That Smooths The Way;
It Helps Us "Mind," It Makes Us Kind
To Others Every Day.

2
This World Is Full Of Sorrow,
Of Sickness, Death, And Sin;
With Loving Heart We'Ll Do Our Part,
And Try Some Soul To Win.

3
And When This Life Is Over,
And We Are Called Above
Our Song Shall Be, Eternally,
Of Jesus And His Love.
