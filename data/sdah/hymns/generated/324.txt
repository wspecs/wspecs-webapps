324 - Just As I Am, Thine Own To Be


1
Just As I Am, Thine Own To Be,
Friend Of The Young, Who Lovest Me,
To Consecrate Myself To Thee,
O Jesus Christ, I Come.

2
In The Glad Morning Of My Day,
My Life To Give, My Vows To Pay,
With No Reserve And No Delay,
With All My Heart I Come.

3
I Would Live Ever In The Light,
I Would Work Ever For The Right;
I Would Serve Thee With All My Might;
Therefore, To Thee I Come.

4
Just As I Am, Young, Strong, And Free,
To Be The Best That I Can Be
For Truth, And Righteousness, And Thee,
Lord Of My Life, I Come.
