483 - I Need Thee Every Hour


1
I Need Thee Every Hour, Most Gracious Lord;
No Tender Voice Like Thine Can Peace Afford.

Refrain
I Need Thee, O I Need Thee;
Every Hour I Need Thee;
O Bless Me Now, My Savior, I Come To Thee.

2
I Need Thee Every Hour; Stay Thou Nearby;
Temptations Lose Their Power When Thou Art Nigh.

3
I Need Thee Every Hour, In Joy Or Pain;
Come Quickly And Abide, Or Life Is Vain.

4
I Need Thee Every Hour; Teach Me Thy Will;
And Thy Rich Promises In Me Fulfill.
