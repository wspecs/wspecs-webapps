419 - Soon Shall The Trump Of God


1
Soon Shall The Trump Of God
Give Out The Welcome Sound,
That Shakes Death'S Silent Chamber Walls,
And Breaks The Turf Sealed Ground.

2
You Dwellers In The Dust,
Awake, Come Forth, And Sing;
Sharp Has Your Frost Of Winter Been,
But Bright Shall Be Your Spring.

3
'Twas Sown In Weakness Here;
'Twill Then Be Raised In Power;
That Which Was Sown In Earthly Seed
Shall Rise A Heav'Nly Flower.
