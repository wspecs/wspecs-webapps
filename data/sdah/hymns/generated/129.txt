129 - As It Fell Upon A Night


1
As It Fell Upon A Night
In The Winter Weather,
Angels Bright In Starry Height
Began To Sing Together.

2
Shepherds Sleeping On The Plain
Woke To See The Glory,
All Amazed They Stood And Gazed
And Heard The Angels' Story.

3
Unto You A Child Is Born
In A Manger Lowly,
Humble, He, Yet Born To Be
The King Of Love Most Holy.

4
Happy Angels From Afar,
Cease Your Singing Never!
In Excelsis Gloria!
Forever And Forever.
