631 - When On Life A Darkness Falls


1
When On Life A Darkness Falls,
When The Mist Flows Chilling,
Paths And Sign Posts Lost In Doubt,
Loveless, Unfulfilling,
Reach Us, Jesus, From Your Cross,
Though We Feel Forsaken;
Keep Us Through The Aching Night
Till New Dawns Awaken.

2
When The Dreams And Vows Of Youth
Painfully Accuse Us,
Stab Our Conscience, Steal Our Worth,
Christ Will Not Refuse Us:
Peace The World Cannot Provide,
Daily Resurrection,
Strong Companion At Our Side
For Each New Direction.

3
Come And Meet Him, Friend And Lord,
Thro' The Gospel Story:
Open Door To Life And Peace,
Window Into Glory.
All Who Seek Him, Soon Are Found,
Made His Close Relation:
Christ Our Pathway, Christ Our Home,
Christ Our Sure Foundation.
