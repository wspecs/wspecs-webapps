293 - Heavenly Father, Bless Us Now


1
Heavenly Father, Bless Us Now;
At The Cross Of Christ We Bow;
Take Our Guilt And Grief Away;
Hear And Heal Us Now, We Pray.

2
Now, O Lord, This Very Hour,
Send Thy Grace And Show Thy Power;
While We Rest Upon Thy Word,
Come, And Bless Us Now, O Lord!

3
Mercy Now, O Lord, We Plead
In This Hour Of Utter Need;
Turn Us Not Away Unblest;
Calm Our Anguish Into Rest.

4
O Thou Loving, Blessed One,
Rising OÃ©R Us Like The Sun,
Light And Life Art Thou Within:
Savior, Thou, From Every Sin!
