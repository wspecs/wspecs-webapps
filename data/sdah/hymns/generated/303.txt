303 - Beneath The Cross Of Jesus


1
Beneath The Cross Of Jesus
I Fain Would Take My Stand,
The Shadow Of A Mighty Rock
Within A Weary Land;
A Home Within The Wilderness,
A Rest Upon The Way,
From The Burning Of The Noontide Heat,
And The Burden Of The Day.

2
Upon That Cross Of Jesus
Mine Eye At Times Can See
The Very Dying Form Of One
Who Suffered There For Me;
And From My Stricken Heart With Tears
Two Wonders I Confess:
The Wonders Of Redeeming Love
And My Unworthiness.

3
I Take, O Cross, Thy Shadow
For My Abiding Place;
I Ask No Other Sunshine Than
The Sunshine Of His Face;
Content To Let The World Go By,
To Know No Gain Nor Loss,
My Sinful Self My Only Shame,
My Glory All The Cross.
