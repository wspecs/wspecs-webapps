082 - Before Jehovah'S Awful Throne


1
Before Jehovah'S Awful Throne,
Ye Nations, Bow With Sacred Joy;
Know That The Lord Is God Alone;
He Can Create, And He Destroy.

2
His Sovereign Power, Without Our Aid,
Made Us Of Clay, And Formed Us Men;
And When Like Wandering Sheep We Strayed,
He Brought Us To His Fold Again.

3
We'Ll Crowd His Gates With Thankful Songs,
High As The Heavens Our Voices Raise;
And Earth, With Her Ten Thousand Tongues,
Shall Fill His Courts With Sounding Praise.

4
Wide As The World Is His Command,
Vast As Eternity His Love;
Firm As A Rock His Truth Shall Stand,
When Rolling Years Shall Cease To Move.
