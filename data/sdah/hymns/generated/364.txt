364 - O Jesus Christ, To You


1
O Jesus Christ, To You May Hymns Be Rising
In Every City For Your Love And Care;
Inspire Our Worship, Grant The Glad Surprising
That Your Blest Spirit Brings Men Everywhere.

2
Grant Us New Courage Sacrificial Humble
Strong In Your Strength To Venture And To Dare,
To Lift The Fallen, Guide The Feet That Stumble,
Seek Out The Lonely &Amp;God'S Mercy Share

3
Show Us Your Spirit, Brooding OÃ©R Each City,
As You Did Weep Above Jerusalem,
Seeking To Gather All In Love And Pity,
And Healing Those Who Touch Your Garment'S Hem.
