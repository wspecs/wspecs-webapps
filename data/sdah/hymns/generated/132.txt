132 - O Come, All Ye Faithful


1
O Come, All Ye Faithful, Joyful And Triumphant,
O Come Ye, O Come Ye To Bethlehem!
Come And Behold Him, Born The King Of Angels!
O Come, Let Us Adore Him, O Come, Let Us Adore Him,
O Come, Let Us Adore Him, Christ, The Lord!

2
Sing, Choirs Of Angels Sing In Exultation,
O Sing All Ye Citizens Of Heaven Above!
Glory To God, All Glory In The Highest!
O Come, Let Us Adore Him, O Come, Let Us Adore Him,
O Come, Let Us Adore Him, Christ, The Lord!

3
Yea, Lord, We Greet Thee, Born This Happy Morning,
Jesus, To Thee Be All Glory Given;
Word Of The Father, Now In Flesh Appearing!
O Come, Let Us Adore Him, O Come, Let Us Adore Him,
O Come, Let Us Adore Him, Christ, The Lord!
