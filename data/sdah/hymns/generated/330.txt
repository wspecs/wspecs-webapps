330 - Take My Life And Let It Be


1
Take My Life, And Let It Be
Consecrated, Lord, To Thee;
Take My Hands, And Let Them Move
At The Impulse Of Thy Love;
At The Impulse Of Thy Love.

2
Take My Feet, And Let Them Be
Swift And Beautiful For Thee.
Take My Voice, And Let Me Sing
Always, Only, For My King;
Always, Only, For My King.

3
Take My Lips, And Let Them Be
Filled With Messages From Thee.
Take My Silver And My Gold:
Not A Mite Would I Withhold;
Not A Mite Would I Withhold.

4
Take My Will, And Make It Thine,
It Shall Be No Longer Mine;
Take My Heart, It Is Thine Own,
It Shall Be Thy Royal Throne.
It Shall Be Thy Royal Throne.

5
Take My Love, My Lord, I Pour
At Thy Feet Its Treasure Store;
Take Myself, And I Will Be,
Ever, Only, All For Thee.
Ever, Only, All For Thee.
