237 - In The Cross Of Christ I Glory


1
In The Cross Of Christ I Glory,
Towering O'Er The Wrecks Of Time;
All The Light Of Sacred Story
Gathers Round Its Head Sublime.

2
When The Woes Of Life O'Ertake Me,
Hopes Deceive, And Fears Annoy,
Never Shall The Cross Forsake Me.
Lo! It Glows With Peace And Joy.

3
When The Sun Of Bliss Is Beaming
Light And Love Upon My Way,
From The Cross The Radiance Streaming
Adds More Luster To The Day.

4
Bane And Blessing, Pain And Pleasure,
By The Cross Are Sanctified;
Peace Is There That Knows No Measure,
Joys That Through All Time Abide.
