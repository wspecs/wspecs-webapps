422 - Marching To Zion


1
Come, We That Love The Lord,
And Let Our Joys Be Known;
Join In A Song With Sweet Accord,
Join In A Song With Sweet Accord,
And Thus Surround The Throne,
And Thus Surround The Throne.

Refrain
We'Re Marching To Zion,
Beautiful, Beautiful Zion;
We'Re Marching Upward To Zion,
The Beautiful City Of God.

2
Let Those Refuse To Sing
Who Never Knew Our God;
But Children Of The Heav'Nly King,
But Children Of The Heav'Nly King
May Speak Their Joys Abroad,
May Speak Their Joys Abroad.

3
The Hill Of Zion Yields
A Thousand Sacred Sweets
Before We Reach The Heav'Nly Fields,
Before We Reach The Heav'Nly Fields
Or Walk The Golden Streets,
Or Walk The Golden Streets.

4
Then Let Our Songs Abound
And Ev'Ry Tear Be Dry;
We'Re Marching Thru Immanuel'S Ground,
We'Re Marching Thru Immanuel'S Ground
To Fairer Worlds On High,
To Fairer Worlds On High.
