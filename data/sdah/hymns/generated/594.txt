594 - Heir Of The Kingdom


1
Heir Of The Kingdom, O Why Dost Thou Slumber?
Why Art Thou Sleeping So Near Thy Blest Home?
Wake Thee, Arouse Thee, And Gird On Thine Armor,
Speed, For The Moments Are Hurrying On.

2
Heir Of The Kingdom, Say, Why Dost Thou Linger?
How Canst Thou Tarry In Sight Of The Prize?
Up, And Adorn Thee, The Savior Is Coming;
Haste To Receive Him Descending The Skies.

3
Earth'S Mighty Nations, In Strife And Commotion,
Tremble With Terror, And Sink In Dismay;
Listen, 'Tis Nought But The Chariot'S Loud Rumbling;
Heir Of The Kingdom, No Longer Delay.

4
Stay Not, O Stay Not For Earth'S Vain Allurements!
See How Its Glory Is Passing Away;
Break The Strong Fetters The Foe Hath Bound O'Er Thee;
Heir Of The Kingdom, Turn, Turn Thee Away.

5
Keep The Eye Single, The Head Upward Lifted;
Watch For The Glory Of Earth'S Coming King;
Lo! O'Er The Mountaintops Light Is Now Breaking;
Heirs Of The Kingdom, Rejoice Ye And Sing.
