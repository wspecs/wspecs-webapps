337 - Redeemed!


1
Redeemed, How I Love To Proclaim It!
Redeemed By The Blood Of The Lamb;
Redeemed Through His Infinite Mercy,
His Child And Forever I Am.

Refrain
Redeemed, Redeemed,
Redeemed By The Blood Of The Lamb;
Redeemed, Redeemed,
His Child And Forever I Am.

2
Redeemed, And So Happy In Jesus,
No Language My Rapture Can Tell;
I Know That The Light Of His Presence
With Me Doth Continually Dwell.

3
I Know There'S A Crown That Is Waiting
In Yonder Bright Mansion For Me;
And Soon, With The Spirit Made Perfect,
At Home With The Lord I Shall Be.
