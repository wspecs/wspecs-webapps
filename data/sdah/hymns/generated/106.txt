106 - Give To Our God Immortal Praise


1
Give To Our God Immortal Praise;
Mercy And Truth Are All His Ways:
Wonders Of Grace To God Belong,
Repeat His Mercies In Your Song.

2
Give To The Lord Of Lords Renown,
The King Of Kings With Glory Crown:
His Mercies Ever Shall Endure
When Lords And Kings Are Known No More.

3
He Sent His Son With Power To Save
From Guilt And Darkness And The Grave:
Wonders Of Grace To God Belong,
Repeat His Mercies In Your Song.

4
Thro' This Vain World He Guides Our Feet,
And Leads Us To His Heav'Nly Seat;
His Mercies Ever Shall Endure,
When This Vain World Shall Be No More.
