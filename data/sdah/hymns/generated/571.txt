571 - What Does The Lord Require


1
What Does The Lord Require
For Praise And Offering?
What Sacrifice, Desire
Or Tribute Bid You Bring?
Do Justly; Love Mercy;
Walk Humbly With Your God.

2
Rulers Of Men, Give Ear!
Should You Not Justice Show?
Will God Your Pleading Hear,
While Crime And Cruelty Grow?
Do Justly; Love Mercy;
Walk Humbly With Your God.

3
How Shall Our Life Fulfill
God'S Law So Hard And High?
Let Christ Endue Our Will
With Grace To Fortify.
Then Justly, In Mercy
We'Ll Humbly Walk With God.
