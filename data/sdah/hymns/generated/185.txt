185 - Jesus Is All The World To Me


1
Jesus Is All The World To Me,
My Life, My Joy, My All;
He Is My Strength From Day To Day,
Without Him I Would Fall.
When I Am Sad, To Him I Go,
No Other One Can Cheer Me So;
When I Am Sad, He Makes Me Glad,
He'S My Friend.

2
Jesus Is All The World To Me,
My Friend In Trials Sore;
I Go To Him For Blessings, And
He Gives Them O'Er And O'Er.
He Sends The Sunshine And The Rain,
He Sends The Harvest'S Golden Grain;
Sunshine And Rain, Harvest Of Grain,
He'S My Friend.

3
Jesus Is All The World To Me,
And True To Him I'Ll Be;
O How Could I This Friend Deny,
When He'S So True To Me?
Following Him I Know I'M Right,
He Watches O'Er Me Day And Night;
Following Him By Day And Night,
He'S My Friend.

4
Jesus Is All The World To Me,
I Want No Better Friend;
I Trust Him Now, I'Ll Trust Him When
Life'S Fleeting Days Shall End.
Beautiful Life With Such A Friend,
Beautiful Life That Has No End;
Eternal Life, Eternal Joy,
He'S My Friend.
