487 - In The Garden


1
I Come To The Garden Alone,
While The Dew Is Still On The Roses;
And The Voice I Hear, Falling On My Ear,
The Son Of God Discloses.

Refrain
And He Walks With Me,
And He Talks With Me,
And He Tells Me I Am His Own;
And The Joy We Share As We Tarry There,
None Other Has Ever Known.

2
He Speaks, And The Sound Of His Voice
Is So Sweet The Birds Hush Their Singing,
And The Melody That He Gave To Me
Within My Heart Is Ringing.

3
I'D Stay In The Garden With Him
Though The Night Around Me Be Falling,
But He Bids Me Go; Through The Voice Of Woe,
His Voice To Me Is Calling.
