121 - Go, Tell It On The Mountain


Refrain
Go, Tell It On The Mountain,
Over The Hills And Everywhere:
Go, Tell It On The Mountain
That Jesus Christ Is Born!

1
While Shepherds Kept Their Watching
O'Er Silent Flocks By Night,
Behold Throughout The Heavens
There Shone A Holy Light.

2
The Shepherds Feared And Trembled
When Lo! Above The Earth
Rang Out The Angel Chorus
That Hailed Our Savior'S Birth.

3
Down In A Lowly Manger
The Humble Christ Was Born,
And Brought Us God'S Salvation
That Blessed Christmas Morn.
