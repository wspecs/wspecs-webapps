206 - Face To Face


1
Face To Face With Christ My Savior,
Face To Face, What Will It Be,
When With Rapture I Behold Him,
Jesus Christ, Who Died For Me?

Refrain
Face To Face Shall I Behold Him,
Far Beyond The Starry Sky;
Face To Face In All His Glory
I Shall See Him By And By!

2
Only Faintly Now I See Him,
With The Darkening Veil Between,
But A Blessed Day Is Coming,
When His Glory Shall Be Seen.

3
What Rejoicing In His Presence,
When Are Banished Grief And Pain;
When The Crooked Ways Are Straightened,
And The Dark Things Shall Be Plain!

4
Face To Face! Oh, Blissful Moment!
Face To Face To See And Know;
Face To Face With My Redeemer,
Jesus Christ, Who Loves Me So.
