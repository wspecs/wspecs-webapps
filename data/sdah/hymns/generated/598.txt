598 - Watch, Ye Saints


1
Watch, Ye Saints, With Eyelids Waking;
Lo! The Powers Of Heaven Are Shaking;
Keep Your Lamps All Trimmed An Burning,
Ready For Your Lord'S Returning.

Refrain
Lo! He Comes, Lo! Jesus Comes;
Lo! He Come, He Comes All Glorious!
Jesus Comes To Reign Victorious,
Lo! He Comes, Yes, Jesus Comes.

2
Lo! The Promise Of Your Savior,
Pardoned Sin And Purchased Favor,
Blood-Washed Robes And Crowns Of Glory;
Haste To Tell Redemption'S Story.

3
Kingdoms At Their Base Are Crumbling,
Hark! His Chariot Wheels Are Rumbling;
Tell, O Tell Of Grace Abounding,
While The Seventh Trump Is Sounding.

4
Nations Wane, Though Proud And Stately;
Christ His Kingdom Hasteneth Greatly;
Earth Her Latest Pangs Is Summing;
Shout, Ye Saints, Your Lord Is Coming.

5
Sinners, Come, While Christ Is Pleading;
Now For You He'S Interceding;
Haste, Ere Grace And Time Diminished
Shall Proclaim The Mystery Finished.
