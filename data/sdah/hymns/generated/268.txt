268 - Holy Spirit, Light Divine


1
Holy Spirit, Light Divine,
Shine Upon This Heart Of Mine,
Chase The Shades Of Night Away,
Turn My Darkness Into Day.

2
Holy Spirit, Power Divine,
Cleanse This Guilty Heart Of Mine;
Long Has Sin, Without Control,
Held Dominion O'Er My Soul.

3
Holy Ghost, With Joy Divine,
Cheer This Saddened Heart Of Mine,
Bid My Many Woes Depart,
Heal My Wounded, Bleeding Heart.

4
Holy Spirit, All Divine,
Dwell Within This Heart Of Mine,
Cast Down Every Idol Throne,
Reign Supreme, And Reign Alone.
