562 - Come, Sing A Song Of Harvest


1
Come, Sing A Song Of Harvest,
Of Thanks For Daily Food!
To Offer God The First-Fruits
Is Old As Gratitude.

2
Long, Long Ago, The Reapers,
Before They Kept The Feast,
Put First-Fruits In A Basket,
And Took It To The Priest.

3
Shall We, Sometimes Forgetful
Oh Where Creation Starts,
With Science In Our Pockets
Lose Wonder From Our Hearts?

4
May God, The Great Creator,
To Whom All Life Belongs,
Accept These Gifts We Offer,
Our Service And Our Songs.

5
And Lest The World Go Hungry
While We Ourselves Are Fed,
Make Each Of Us More Ready
To Share Our Daily Bread.
