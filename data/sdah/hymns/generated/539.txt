539 - I Will Early Seek The Savior


1
I Will Early Seek The Savior,
I Will Learn Of Him Each Day;
I Will Follow In His Footsteps,
I Will Walk The Narrow Way.

Refrain
For He Loves Me, Yes, He Loves Me,
Jesus Loves Me, This I Know.
Jesus Loves Me, Died To Save Me,
This Is Why I Love Him So.

2
I Will Hasten Where He Bids Me,
I Am Not Too Young To Go
In The Pathway Where He Leadeth,
Not Too Young His Will To Know.

3
He Is Standing At The Doorway
Of Escape From Every Sin;
I Will Knock, For He Has Promised,
He Will Hear And Let Me In.
