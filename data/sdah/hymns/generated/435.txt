435 - The Glory Song


1
When All My Labors And Trails Are O'Er,
And I Am Safe On That Beautiful Shore,
Just To Be Near The Lord I Adore,
Will Through The Ages Be Glory For Me.

Refrain
O That Will Be
O      That Will
Glory For Me, Glory For Me,
Be    Glory For Me,    Glory For Me,
Glory For Me; When By His Grace
Glory For Me;
I Shall Look On His Face,
That Will Be Glory, Be Glory For Me.

2
When, By The Gift Of His Infinite Grace,
I Am Accorded In Heaven A Place,
Just To Be There And To Look On His Face,
Will Through The Ages Be Glory For Me.

3
Friends Will Be There I Have Loved Long Ago;
Joy Like A River Around Me Will Flow,
Yet, Just A Smile Form My Savior, I Know,
Will Through The Ages Be Glory For Me.
