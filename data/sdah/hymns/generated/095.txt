095 - Spring Has Now Unwrapped The Flowers


1
Spring Has Now Unwrapped The Flowers,
Day Is Fast Reviving,
Life In All Her Growing Powers
Towards The Light Is Striving:
Gone The Iron Touch Of Cold,
Winter Time And Frost Time,
Seedlings, Working Through The Mould,
Now Make Up For Lost Time.

2
Herb And Plant That Winter Long,
Slumbered At Their Leisurek,
Now Be Stirring, Green And Strong,
Find In Growth Their Pleasure:
All The World With Beauty Fills,
Gold The Green Enhacing;
Flowers Make Glee Among The Hills,
Set The Meadows Dancing.

3
Through Each Wonder Of Fair Days
God Himself Expresses;
Beauty Follows All His Ways,
As The World He Blesses:
So, As He Renews The Earth,
Artist Without Rival,
In His Grace Of Glad New Birth
We Must Seek Revival.
