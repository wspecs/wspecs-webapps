183 - I Will Sing Of Jesus' Love


1
I Will Sing Of Jesus Love,
Sing Of Him,Who First Loved Me;
For He Left Bright Worlds Above,
And Died On Calvary.

Refrain
I Will Sing Of Jesus Love
Endless Praise My Heart Shall Give;
He Has Died That I Might Live
I Will Sing His Love To Me.

2
O The Depths Of Love Divine!
Earth Or Heaven Can Never Know
How That Sin As Dark As Mine
Can Be Made As White As Snow.

3
Nothing Good For Him I'Ve Done;
How Could He Such Love Bestow?
Lord, I Own My Heart Is Won,
Help Me Now My Love To Show.
