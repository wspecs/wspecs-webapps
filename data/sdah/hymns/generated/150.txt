150 - Who Is He In Yonder Stall


1
Who Is He In Yonder Stall,
At Whose Feet The Shepherds Fall?

Refrain
'Tis The Lord, O Wondrous Story,
'Tis The Lord, The King Of Glory!
At His Feet We Humbly Fall,
Crown Him, Crown Him Lord Of All.
At His Feet We Humbly Fall- The Lord Of All.
Crown Him, Crown Him, Jesus, Jesus,
Crown Him Lord Of All.

2
Who Is He In Deep Distress,
Fasting In The Wilderness?

3
Who Is He, The Gathering Throng
Greet With Loud Triumphant Song?

4
Lo, At Midnight, Who Is He
Prays In Dark Gethsemane?

5
Who Is He On Yonder Tree
Dies In Shame And Agony?

6
Who Is He That From The Grave
Comes To Heal And Help And Save?

7
Who Is He That From His Throne
Rules Through All The World Alone?
