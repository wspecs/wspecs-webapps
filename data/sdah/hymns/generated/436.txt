436 - The Homeland


1
The Homeland! O The Homeland!
The Land Of The Free Born!
There'S No Night In The Homeland,
But Aye The Fadeless Morn;
I'M Sighing For Homeland,
My Heart Is Aching Here;
There Is No Pain In The Homeland
To Which I'M Drawing Near;
There Is No Pain In The Homeland
To Which I'M Drawing Near.

2
My Lord Is In The Homeland,
With Angels Bright And Fair;
There'S No Sin In The Homeland,
And No Temptation There;
The Music Of The Homeland
Is Ringing In My Ears;
And When I Think Of The Homeland
My Eyes Are Filled With Tears;
And When I Think Of The Homeland
My Ears Are Filled With Tears.

3
The Dwellers In The Homeland
Are Beckoning Me To Come,
Where Neither Death Nor Sorrow
Invades Their Holy Name;
O Dear, Dear Native Country!
O Rest And Peace Above!
Christ Bring Us All To The Homeland
Of Thy Redeeming Love;
Christ Bring Us All To The Homeland
Of Thy Redeeming Love
