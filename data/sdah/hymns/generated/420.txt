420 - Jerusalem, My Happy Home


1
Jerusalem, My Happy Home,
O How I Long For Thee!
When Will My Sorrows Have An End,
The Joys When Shall I See?

2
The Walls Are All Of Precious Stone,
Most Glorious To Behold;
Thy Gates Are Richly Set With Pearl,
Thy Streets Are Paved With Gold.

3
Thy Garden And Thy Pleasant Walks
My Study Long Have Been;
Such Dazzling Views By Human Sight
Have Never Yet Been Seen.

4
Lord, Help Us By Thy Mighty Grace,
To Keep In View The Prize,
Till Thou Dost Come To Take Us Home
To That Blessed Paradise.
