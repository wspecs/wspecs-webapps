023 - Now The Joyful Bells A-Ringing


1
Now The Joyful Bells A-Ring,
All Ye Mountains Of The Lord!
Lift Our Hearts Like Birds A-Winging,
All Ye Mountains, Praise The Lord!
Now Our Festal Season Bringing
Kinsmen All To Bide And Board,
Sets Our Cheery Voices Singing;
All Ye Mountains, Praise The Lord!

2
Dear Our Home As Dear None Other;
Where The Mountains Praise The Lord!
Gladly Here Our Care We Smother;
Where The Mountains Praise The Lord!
Here We Know That Christ Our Brother
Binds Us All As By A Cord:
He Was Born Of Mary Mother
Where The Mountains Praise The Lord!

3
Cold The Year, New Whiteness Wearing,
All Ye Mountains, Praise The Lord!
Peace, Good Will To Us A-Bearing,
All Ye Mountains, Praise The Lord!
Now We All God'S Goodness Sharing
Break The Bread And Sheath The Sword:
Bright Our Hearths The Signal Flaring,
All Ye Mountains, Praise The Lord!
