375 - Work, For The Night Is Coming


1
Work For The Night Is Coming,
Work Through The Morning Hours;
Work While The Dew Is Sparkling;
Work 'Mid Springing Flow'Rs.
Work When The Day Grows Brighter,
Work In The Glowing Sun;
Work For The Night Is Coming,
When Man'S Work Is Done.

2
Work For The Night Is Coming,
Work Thro' The Sunny Noon;
Fill Brightest Hours With Labor,
Rest Comes Sure And Soon.
Give Every Flying Minute
Something To Keep In Store;
Work For The Night Is Coming,
When Man Works No More.

3
Work For The Night Is Coming,
Under The Sunset Skies;
While Their Bright Tints Are Glowing,
Work For Daylight Flies.
Work Till The Last Beam Fadeth,
Fadeth To Shine No More;
Work While The Night Is Dark'Ning,
When Man'S Work Is O'Er.
