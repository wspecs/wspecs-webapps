625 - Higher Ground


1
I'M Pressing On The Upward Way,
New Heights I'M Gaining Every Day;
Still Praying As I'M Onward Bound,
"Lord, Plant My Feet On Higher Ground."

Refrain
Lord, Lift Me Up And Let Me Stand,
By Faith, On Heaven'S Table Land,
A Higher Plane Than I Have Found;
Lord, Plant My Feet On Higher Ground.

2
My Heart Has No Desire To Stay
Where Doubts Arise And Fears Dismay;
Though Some May Dwell Where Those Abound,
My Prayer, My Aim, Is Higher Ground.

3
I Want To Live Above The World,
Though Satan'S Darts At Me Are Hurled;
For Faith Has Caught The Joyful Sound,
The Song Of Saints On Higher Ground.

4
I Want To Scale The Utmost Height
And Catch A Gleam Of Glory Bright;
But Still I'Ll Pray Till Heav'N I'Ve Found,
"Lord, Plant My Feet On Higher Ground."
