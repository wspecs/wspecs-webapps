209 - That Glorious Day Is Coming


1
That Glorious Day Is Coming,
The Hour Is Hastening On;
Its Radiant Light Is Nearing,
Far Brighter Than The Sun;
In Yonder Clouds Of Heaven,
The Saviour Will Appear,
And Gather All His Chosen,
To Meet Him In The Air.
The Saints, Then All Victorious
Will Go To Meet Their Lord;
An Earth Both Bright And Glorious,
Will Then Be Their Reward;
And God Himself There Reigning,
Will Wipe All Tears Away;
Nor Clouds Nor Night Remaining,
But One Eternal Day.

2
O Christian, Keep From Sleeping,
And Let Your Love Abound;
Be Watchful, Prayerful, Faithful,
The Trumpet Soon Will Sound!
O Sinner, Hear The Warning!
To Jesus Quickly Fly!
Then You, In That Blest Morning,
May Meet Him In The Sky!
