190 - Jesus Loves Me


1
Jesus Loves Me! This I Know,
For The Bible Tells Me So;
Little Ones To Him Belong
They Are Weak But He Is Strong

Refrain
Yes, Jesus Loves Me!
Yes, Jesus Loves Me!
Yes, Jesus Loves Me!
The Bible Tells Me So.

2
Jesus Loves Me! He Wo Died
Heaven'S Gate To Open Wide:
He Will Wash Away My Sin,
Let His Little Child Come In.

3
Jesus, Take This Heart Of Mine,
Make It Pure And Wholly Thine;
On The Coross You Died For Me,
I Will Love And Live For Thee.
