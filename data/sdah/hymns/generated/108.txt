108 - Amazing Grace


1
Amazing Grace! How Sweet The Sound
That Saved A Wretch Like Me!
I Once Was Lost, But Now Am Found;
Was Blind, But Now I See.

2
'Twas Grace That Taught My Heart To Fear,
And Grace My Fears Relieved;
How Precious Did That Grace Appear
The Hour I First Believed.

3
The Lord Has Promised Good To Me,
His Word My Hope Secures;
He Will My Shield And Portion Be,
As Long As Life Endures.

4
Through Many Dangers, Toils, And Snares,
I Have Already Come;
'Tis Grace Hath Brought Me Safe Thus Far,
And Grace Will Lead Me Home.

5
When We'Ve Been There Ten Thousand Years,
Bright Shining As The Sun,
We'Ve No Less Days To Sing God'S Praise
Than When We First Begun.
