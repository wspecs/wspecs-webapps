031 - Tell Out, My Soul


1
Tell Out My Soul, The Greatness Of The Lord:
Unnumbered Blessings, Give My Spirit Voice;
Tender To Me The Promise Of His Word;
In God My Saviour Shall My Heart Rejoice.

2
Tell Out, My Soul, The Greatness Of His Name:
Make Known His Might, The Deeds His Arm Has Done;
His Mercy Sure, From Age To Age The Same;
His Holy Name, The Lord, The Mighty One.

3
Tell Out, My Soul, The Greatness Of His Might:
Pow'Rs And Dominions Lay Their Glory By;
Proud Hearts And Stubborn Wills Are Put To Flight,
The Hungry Fed, The Humble Lifted High.

4
Tell Out, My Soul, The Glories Of His Word:
Firm Is His Promise, And His Mercy Sure.
Tell Out, My Soul, The Greatness Of The Lord
To Children'S Children And Forevermore.
