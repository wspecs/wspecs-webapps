011 - The God Of Abraham Praise


1
The God Of Abraham Praise,
Who Reigns Enthroned Above;
Ancient Of Everlasting Days,
And God Of Love;
Jehovah! Great I Am!
By Earth And Heaven Confessed;
I Bow And Bless The Sacred Name,
Forever Blest.

2
The God Of Abraham Praise,
At Whose Supreme Command
From Earth I Rise, And Seek The Joys
At His Right Hand;
I All On Earth Forsake,
Its Wisdom, Fame And Power;
And Him My Only Portion Make,
My Shield And Tower.

3
The Whole Triumphant Host
Give Thanks To God On High;
"Hail, Father, Son, And Holy Ghost!"
They Ever Cry;
Hail, Abraham'S God And Mine!
I Join The Heavenly Lays;
All Might And Majesty Are Thine,
And Endless Praise.
