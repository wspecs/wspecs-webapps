233 - Christ, Whose Glory Fills The Skies


1
Christ, Whose Glory Fills The Skies,
Christ, The True, The Only Light,
Sun Of Righteousness, Arise,
Triumph O'Er The Shades Of Night;
Dayspring From On High, Be Near;
Daystar, In My Heart Appear.

2
Dark And Cheerless Is The Morn
Unaccompanied By Thee;
Joyless Is The Day'S Return,
Till Thy Mercy'S Beams I See;
Till They Inward Light Impart,
Cheer My Eyes And Warm My Heart.

3
Visit Then This Soul Of Mine;
Pierce The Gloom Of Sin And Grief;
Fill Me, Radiancy Divine,
Scatter All My Unbelief;
More And More Thyself Display,
Shining To The Perfect Day.
