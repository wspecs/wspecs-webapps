374 - Jesus, With Thy Church Abide


1
Jesus, With Thy Church Abide;
Be Her Savior, Lord, And Guide,
While On Earth Her Faith Is Tried:
We Beseech Thee, Hear Us.

2
May Her Voice Be Ever Clear,
Warning Of A Judgment Near,
Telling Of A Savior Dear:
We Beseech Thee, Hear Us.

3
May She Guide The Poor And Blind,
Seek The Lost Until She Find,
And The Broken Hearted Bind:
We Beseech Thee, Hear Us.

4
May She Holy Triumps Win,
Overthrow The Hosts Of Sin,
Gather All The Nations In:
We Beseech Thee, Hear Us.
