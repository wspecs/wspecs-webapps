235 - Christ Is Made The Sure Foundation


1
Christ Is Made The Sure Foundation,
Christ The Head And Cornerstone,
Chosen Of The Lord, And Precious,
Binding All The Church In One;
Holy Zion'S Help For Ever,
And Her Confidence Alone.

2
All That Dedicated City,
Dearly Loved Of God On High,
In Exultant Jubilation
Pours Perpetual Melody;
God The One In Three Adoring
In Glad Hymns Eternally.

3
To This Temple, Where We Call Thee,
Come, O Lord Of Hosts, Today;
With Thy Wonted Loving-Kindness
Hear Thy Servants As They Pray,
And Thy Fullest Benediction
Shed Within Its Walls Alway.

4
Here Vouchsafe To All Thy Servants
What They Ask Of Thee Of Gain;
What They Gain From Thee, For Ever
With The BlessÃ¨D To Retain,
And Hereafter In Thy Glory
Evermore With Thee To Reign.

5
Laud And Honor To The Father,
Laud And Honor To The Son,
Laud And Honor To The Spirit,
Ever Three, And Ever One,
Con-Substantial, Co-Eternal,
While Unending Ages Run.
