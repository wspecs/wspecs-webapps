I Need The Prayers Of Those I Love,
While Trav'Ling O'Er Life'S Rugged Way,
That I May True And Faithful Be,
And Live For Jesus Every Day.

Refrain
I Want My Friends To Pray For Me,
To Bear My Tempted Soul Above,
And Intercede With God For Me;
I Need The Prayers Of Those I Love.

I Need The Prayers Of Those I Love,
To Help Me In Each Trying Hour,
To Bear My Tempted Sould To Him,
That He May Keep Me By His Pow'R.

Refrain
I Want My Friends To Pray For Me,
To Hold Me Up On Wing Of Faith,
That I May Walk The Narrow Way,
Kept By Our Father'S Glorious Grace.
