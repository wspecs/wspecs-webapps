577 - In The Heart Of Jesus


1
In The Heart Of Jesus There Is Love For You,
Love Most Pure And Tender, Love Most Deep And True;
Why Should You Be Lonely, Why For Friendship Sigh,
When The Heart Of Jesus Has A Full Supply?

2
In The Mind Of Jesus There Is Thought For You,
Warm As Summer Sunshine, Sweet As Morning Dew;
Why Should You Be Fearful, Why Take Anxious Thought,
Since The Mind Of Jesus Cares For Those He Bought?

3
In The Field Of Jesus There Is Work For You;
Such As Even Angels Might Rejoice To Do;
Why Stand Idly Sighing For Some Lifework Grand,
While The Field Of Jesus Seeks Your Reaping Hand?

4
In The Home Of Jesus There'S A Place For You;
Glorious, Bright, And Joyous, Calm And Peaceful Too;
Why Then, Like A Wanderer, Roam With Weary Pace,
If The Home Of Jesus Holds For You A Place?
