Spirit Divine, Attend Our Prayers,
And Make This House Thy Home;
Descend With All Thy Gracious Powers,
O Come, Great Spirit, Come!

Come As The Light; To Us Reveal
Our Emptiness And Woe,
And Lead Us In Those Paths Of Life
Where-On The Righteous Go.

Come As The Fire, And Purge Our Hearts
Like Sacrificial Flame;
Let Our Whole Soul An Of - F'Ring Be
To Our Redeemer'S Name.

Come As The Dove, And Spread Thy Wings,
The Wings Of Peaceful Love;
And Let Thy Church On Earth Become
Blest As The Church Above.

5
Spirit Divine, Attend Our Prayers,
Make A Lost World Thy Home;
Descend With All Thy Gracious Powers,
O Come, Great Spirit, Come!
