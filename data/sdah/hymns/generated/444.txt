444 - I'M A Pilgrim


1
I'M A Pilgrim, And I'M A Stranger;
I Can Tarry, I Can Tarry But A Night;
Do Not Detain Me, For I Am Going
To Where The Fountains Are Ever Flowing.

Refrain
I'M A Pilgrim, And I'M A Stranger;
I Can Tarry, I Can Tarry But A Night.

2
There The Glory Is Ever Shining!
O, My Longing Heart, My Longing Heart Is There;
Here In This Country So Dark And Dreary,
I Long Have Wandered Forlorn And Weary.

3
There'S The City To Which I Journey;
My Redeemer, My Redeemer Is Its Light!
There Is No Sorrow, Nor Any Sighing,
Nor Any Tears There, Or Any Dying.
