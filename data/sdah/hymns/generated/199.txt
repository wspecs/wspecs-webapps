199 - The Head That Once Was Crowned


1
The Head That Once Was Crowned With Thorns
Is Crowned With Glory Now;
A Royal Diadem Adorns
The Mighty Victor'S Brow.

2
The Highest Place That Heaven Affords
Is His, Is His By Right;
The King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords,
And Heaven'S Eternal Light.

3
The Joy Of All Who Dwell Above,
The Joy Of All Below,
To Whom He Manifests His Love,
And Grants His Name To Know.

4
To Them The Cross, With All Its Shame,
With All Its Grace Is Given;
Their Name An Everlasting Name,
Their Joy The Joy Of Heaven.

5
To Them The Cross, With All Its Shame,
With All Its Grace Is Given;
Their Name An Everlasting Name,
Their Joy The Joy Of Heaven.
