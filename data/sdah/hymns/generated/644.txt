644 - O God, Whose Will Is Life And Good


1
O God, Whose Will Is Life And Good
For All Of Mortal Breath:
Unite In Bonds Of Servanthood
All Those Who Strive With Death.

2
Make Strong Their Hands And Hearts And Wills
To Drive Disease Afar,
To Strive Against The Body'S Ills
And Wage Your Healing War.

3
By Healing Of The Sick And Blind,
Christ'S Mercy They Proclaim,
Make Known The Great Physician'S Mind,
Affirm The Savior'S Name.

4
Before Them Set Your Gracious Will,
That They, With Heart And Soul,
To You May Consecrate Their Skill
And Make The Sufferer Whole.
