039 - Lord, In The Morning


1
Lord, In The Morning Thou Shalt Hear
My Voice Ascending High;
To Thee Will I Direct My Prayer,
To Thee Lift Up Mine Eye-

2
Up To The Hills Where Christ Is Gone
To Plead For All His Saints,
Presenting At His Father'S Throne
Our Songs And Our Complaints.

3
O May Thy Spirit Guide My Feet
In Ways Of Righteousness;
Make Every Path Of Duty Straight
And Plain Before My Face.
4 The Men That Love And Fear Thy Name
Shall See Their Hopes Fulfilled;
The Mighty God Will Compass Them
With Favor As A Shield.
