043 - When Morning Gilds The Skies


1
When Morning Gilds The Skies My Heart Awaking Cries,
May Jesus Christ Be Praised!
Alike At Work And Prayer,
To Jesus I Repair:
May Jesus Christ Be Praised!

2
Whene'Er The Sweet Church Bell Peals Over Hill And Dell,
May Jesus Christ Praised!
O Hark To What It Sings,
As Joyously It Rings,
May Jesus Christ Be Praised!

3
The Night Becomes As Day When From The Heart We Say:
May Jesus Christ Be Praised!
The Powers Of Darkness Fear
When This Sweet Chant They Hear:
May Jesus Christ Be Praised!

4
Ye Nations Of Mankind, In This Your Concord Find,
May Jesus Christ Praised!
Let All The Earth Around Ring
Joyous With The Sound,
May Jesus Christ Praised!

5
In Heaven'S Eternal Bliss The Loveliest Strain Is This,
May Jesus Christ Praised!
Let Earth, And Sea And Sky
From Depth To Height Reply,
May Jesus Christ Praised!

6
Be This, While Life Is Mine, My Canticle Divine:
May Jesus Christ Be Praised!
Be This Th'Eternal Song
Through All The Ages Long,
May Jesus Christ Be Praised!
