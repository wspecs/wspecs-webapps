151 - Jesus Walked This Lonesome Valley


1
Jesus Walked This Lonesome Valley;
He Had To Walk It By Himself.
O Nobody Else Could Walk It For Him.
He Had To Walk It By Himself.

2
I Must Go And Stand My Trial.
I Have To Stand It By Myself.
O Nobody Else Could Stand It For Me.
I Have To Stand It By Myself.

3
Jesus Walked This Lonesome Valley;
He Had To Walk It By Himself.
O Nobody Else Could Walk It For Him.
He Had To Walk It By Himself.
