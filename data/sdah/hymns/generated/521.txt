521 - Depth Of Mercy


1
Depth Of Mercy!-Can There Be
Mercy Still Reserved For Me?
Can My God His Wrath Forbear?
Me, The Chief Of Sinners, Spare?

2
I Have Long Withstood His Grace,
Long Provoked Him To His Face,
Would Not Hearken To His Calls,
Grieved Him By A Thousand Falls.

3
Now Incline Me To Repent;
Let Me Now My Sins Lament;
Now My Foul Revolt Deplore,
Weep, Believe, And Sin No More.

4
There For Me The Savior Stands,
Shows His Wounds And Spreads His Hands;
God Is Love! I Know, I Feel;
Jesus Weeps, And Loves Me Still.
