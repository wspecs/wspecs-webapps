302 - Deeper Yet


1
In The Blood From The Cross,
I Have Been Washed From Sin;
But To Be Free From Dross,
Still I Would Enter In.

Refrain
Deeper Yet, Deeper Yet,
Into The Crimson Flood;
Deeper Yet, Deeper Yet,
Under The Precious Blood.

2
Day By Day, Hour By Hour,
Blessings Are Sent To Me;
But For More Of His Power,
Ever My Prayer Shall Be.

3
Near To Christ I Would Live,
Following Him Each Day;
What I Ask He Will Give;
So Then With Faith I Pray.

4
Now I Have Peace, Sweet Peace,
While In This World Of Sin;
But To Pray I'Ll Not Cease
Till I Am Pure Within.
