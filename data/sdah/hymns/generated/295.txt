295 - Chief Of Sinners


1
Chief Of Sinners Though I Be,
Jesus Shed His Blood For Me;
Died That I Might Live On High,
Died That I Might Never Die;
As The Brance Is To The Vine,
I Am His, And He Is Mine.

2
O The Height Of Jesus' Love!
Higher Than The Heaven Above,
Deeper Than The Deepest Sea,
Lasting As Eternity;
Love That Found Me-Wondrous Thought!
Found Me When I Sought Him Not!

3
Chief Of Sinners Though I Be,
Christ Is All In All To Me;
All My Wants To Him Are Known,
All My Sorrows Are His Own;
Safe With Him From Earthly Strife,
He Sustains The Hidden Life.
