559 - Now Thank We All Our God


1
Now Thank We All Our God
With Heart And Hands And Voices,
Who Wondrous Things Hath Done,
In Whom His World Rejoices;
Who, From Our Mothers' Arms
Hath Blessed Us On Our Way
With Countless Gifts Of Love,
And Still Is Ours Today.

2
O May This Bounteous God
Through All Our Life Be Near Us,
With Ever Joyful Hearts
And Blessed Peace To Cheer Us;
And Keep Us Still In Grace,
And Guide Us When Perplexed;
And Free Us From All Ills,
In This World And The Next.

3
All Praise And Thanks To God
The Father Now Be Given;
The Son, And Him Who Reigns
With Them In Highest Heaven;
The One Eternal God,
Whom Earth And Heaven Adore;
For Thus It Was, Is Now,
And Shall Be Evermore.
