215 - The King Shall Come


1
The King Shall Come When Morning Dawns
And Light Triumphant Breaks,
When Beauty Gilds The Eastern Hills
And Life To Joy Awakes.

2
Not As Of Old A Little Child,
To Bear And Fight And Die,
But Crowned With Glory Like The Sun
That Lights The Morning Sky.

3
O, Brighter Than That Rising Morn
When Christ, Victorious, Rose
And Left The Lonesome Place Death,
Despite The Rage Of Foes.

4
O, Brighter Than That Glorious Morn
Shall Dawn Upon Our Race
They Day When Christ In Splendour Comes,
And We Shall See His Face.

5
The King Shall Come When Morning Dawns
And Light And Beauty Brings.
Hail, Christ The Lord! Your People Pray:
Come Quickly, King Of Kings.
