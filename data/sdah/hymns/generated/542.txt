542 - Jesus, Friend So Kind


1
Jesus, Friend, So Kind And Gentle,
Little Ones We Bring To Thee:
Grant To Them Thy Dearest Blessing,
Let Thine Arms Around Them Be;
Now Enfold Them In Thy Goodness,
From All Danger Keep Them Free.

2
Thou Who Did Receive The Children
To Thyself So Tenderly,
Give To All Who Teach And Guide Them
Wisdom And Humility.
Vision True To Keep Them Noble,
Love To Serve Them Faithfully.
