195 - Showers Of Blessing


1
"There Shall Be Showers Of Blessing;"
This Is The Promise Of Love;
There Shall Be Seasons Refreshing,
Sent From The Savior Above.

Refrain
Showers Of Blessing,
Showers Of Blessing We Need;
Mercy Drops Round Us Are Falling,
But For The Showers We Plead.

2
"There Shall Be Showers Of Blessing;"
Precious Reviving Again;
Over The Hills And The Valleys,
Sound Of Abundance Of Rain.

3
"There Shall Be Showers Of Blessing;"
Send Them Upon Us, O Lord;
Grant To Us Now A Refreshing;
Come, And Now Honor Thy Word.

4
"There Shall Be Showers Of Blessing;"
O That Today They Might Fall,
Now As To God Were Confessing,
Now As On Jesus We Call!
