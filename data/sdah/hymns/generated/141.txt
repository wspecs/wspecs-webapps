141 - What Child Is This


1
What Child Is This, Who, Laid To Rest,
On Mary`S Lap Is Sleeping?
Whom Angels Greet With Anthems Sweet,
While Shepherds Watch Are Keeping?

Refrain
This, This Is Christ The King,
Whom Shepherds Guard And Angels Sing:
Haste, Haste To Bring Him Laud,
The Babe, The Son Of Mary.

2
Why Lies He In Such Mean Estate
Where Ox And Ass Are Feeding?
Good Christian, Fear: For Sinners Here
The Silent Word Is Pleading.

3
So Bring Him Incense, Gold, And Myrrh,
Come, Peasant, King, To Own Him,
The King Of Kings Salvation Brings,
Let Loving Hearts Enthrone Him.
