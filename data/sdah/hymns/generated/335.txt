Christ Has For Sin Atonement Made,
What A Wonderful Saviour!
We Are Redeemed! The Price Is Paid!
What A Wonderful Savior!

What A Wonderful Savior
Is Jesus, My Jesus!
What A Wonderful Savior
Is Jesus, My Lord!

I Praise Him For The Cleansing Blood,
What A Wonderful Saviour!
That Reconciled My Soul To God;
What A Wonderful Saviour!

He Walks Beside Me All The Way,
What A Wonderful Saviour!
And Keeps Me Faithful Day By Day;
What A Wonderful Saviour!

He Gives Me Overcoming Power,
What A Wonderful Saviour!
And Triumph In Each Trying Hour;
What A Wonderful Saviour!
