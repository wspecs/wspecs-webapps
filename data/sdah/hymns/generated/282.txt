282 - I Hear Thy Welcome Voice


1
I Hear Thy Welcome Voice,
That Calls Me, Lord, To Thee;
For Cleansing In Thy Precious Blood,
That Flowed On Calvary.

Refrain
I Am Coming, Lord!
Coming Now To Thee!
Wash Me, Cleanse Me, In The Blood
That Flowed On Calvary.

2
Though Coming Weak And Vile,
Thou Dost My Strength Assure;
Thou Dost My Vileness Fully Cleanse,
Till Spotless All, And Pure.

3
'Tis Jesus Calls Me On
To Perfect Faith And Love,
To Perfect Hope, And Peace, And Trust,
For Earth And Heaven Above.

4
All Hail, Atoning Blood!
All Hail, Redeeming Grace!
All Hail! The Gift Of Christ, Our Lord,
Our Strength And Righteousness.
