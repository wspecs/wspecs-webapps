085 - Eternal Father Strong To Save


1
Eternal Father, Strong To Save,
Whose Arm Doth Bind The Restless Wave,
Who Bidd'St The Mighty Ocean Deep
Its Own Appointed Limits Keep;
O Hear Us When We Cry To Thee
For Those In Peril On The Sea.

2
O Saviour, Whose Almighty Word
The Winds And Waves Submissive Heard,
Who Walkedst On The Foaming Deep,
And Calm Amid Its Rage Didst Sleep;
O Hear Us When We Cry To Thee
For Those In Peril On The Sea.

3
O Sacred Spirit, Who Didst Brood
Upon The Chaos Dark And Rude,
Who Badd'St Its Angry Tumult Cease,
And Gavest Light And Life And Peace;
O Hear Us When We Cry To Thee
For Those In Peril On The Sea.

4
O Trinity Of Love And Power,
Our Brethren Shield In Danger'S Hour;
From Rock And Tempest, Fire And Foe,
Protect Them Wheresoe'Er They Go;
And Ever Let There Rise To Thee
Glad Hymns Of Praise From Land And Sea.
