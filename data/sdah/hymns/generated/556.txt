556 - As Saints Of Old


1
As Saints Of Old Their First Fruits Brought
Of Orchard, Flock, And Field
To God The Giver All Good,
The Source Of Bounteous Yield;
So We Today First Fruits Would Bring:
The Wealth Of This Good Land,
Of Farm And Market, Shop And Home,
Of Mind, And Heart, And Hand.

2
A World In Need Now Summons Us
To Labor, Love, And Give;
To Make Our Life An Offering
To God, That All May Live.
The Church Of Christ Is Calling Us
To Make The Dream Come True:
A World Redeemed By Christ-Like Love;
All Life In Christ Made New.

3
In Gratitude And Humble Trust
We Bring Our Best Today,
To Serve Your Cause And Share Your Love
With All Along Life'S Way.
O God, Who Gave Yourself To Us
In Jesus Christ Your Son,
Teach Us To Give Ourselves Each Day
Until Life'S Work Is Done.
