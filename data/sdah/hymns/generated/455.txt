455 - Immortal Love, Forever Full


1
Immortal Love, Forever Full,
Forever Flowing Free,
Forever Shared, Forever Whole,
A Never Ebbing Sea!

2
We Nay Not Climb The Heavenly Steeps
To Bring The Lord Christ Down;
In Vain We Search The Lowest Deeps,
For Him No Depths Can Drown.

3
But Warm, So Tender, Even Yet
A Present Help Is He;
And Faith Has Still Its Olivet,
And Love Its Galilee.

4
The Healing Of His Seamless Dress
Is By Our Beds Of Pain;
We Touch Him In Life'S Throng And Press,
And We Are Whole Again.

5
Through Him The First Fond Prayers Are Said,
Our Lips Of Childhood Frame;
The Last Low Whispers Of Our Dead
Are Burdened With His Name.

6
O Lord And Master Of Us All:
Whate'Er Our Names Or Sign,
We Own Thy Sway, We Hear Thy Call,
We Test Our Lives By Thine!
