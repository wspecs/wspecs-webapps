526 - Because He Lives


1
God Sent His Son, They Called Him Jesus,
He Came To Love, Heal, And Forgive;
He Lived And Died To Buy My Pardon,
An Empty Grave Is There To Prove My Savior Lives.

Refrain
Because He Lives I Can Face Tomorrow,
Because He Lives All Fear Is Gone;
Because I Know He Holds The Future.
And Life Is Worth The Living Just Because He Lives.

2
How Sweet To Hold A Newborn Baby,
And Feel The Pride, And Joy He Gives;
But Greater Still The Calm Assurance,
This Child Can Face Uncertain Days Because He Lives.
