252 - Come, Let Us Sing


1
Come, Let Us Sing The Song Of Songs-
The Angels First Began The Strain-
The Homage Which To Christ Belongs:
"Worthy The Lamb, For He Was Slain!"

2
Slain To Redeem Us By His Blood,
To Cleanse From Every Sinful Stain,
And Make Us Kings And Priests To God:
"Worthy The Lamb, For He Was Slain!"

3
To Him Who Suffered On The Tree,
Our Souls, At His Soul'S Price, To Gain,
Blessing, And Praise, And Glory Be:
"Worthy The Lamb, For He Was Slain!"

4
To Him, Enthroned By Filial Right
All Power In Heaven And Earth Proclaim,
Honor, And Majesty, And Might:
"Worthy The Lamb, For He Was Slain!"

5
Long As We Live, And When We Die,
And While In Heaven With Him We Reign,
This Song Our Song Of Songs Shall Be:
"Worthy The Lamb, For He Was Slain!"
