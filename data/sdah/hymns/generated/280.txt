280 - Come, Ye Sinners


1
Come, Ye Sinners Poor And Needy,
Weak And Wounded, Sick And Sore;
Jesus Ready Stands To Save You,
Full Of Pity, Love, And Power.

Refrain
I Will Arise And Go To Jesus,
He Will Embrace Me In His Arms;
In The Arms Of My Dear Savior,
O There Are Ten Thousand Charms.

2
Come. Ye Thirsty, Come, And Welcome,
God'S Free Bounty Glorify;
True Belief And True Repentance,
Every Grace That Brings You Nigh.

3
Let Not Conscience Make You Linger,
Nor Of Fitness Fondly Dream;
All The Fitness He Requireth
Is To Feel Your Need Of Him.

4
Lo! Th'Incarnate God, Ascended,
Pleads The Merit Of His Blood;
Venture On Him, Venture Wholly,
Let No Other Trust Intrude.
