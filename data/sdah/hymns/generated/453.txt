453 - We Have Heard


1
We Have Heard From The Bright, The Holy, Land;
We Have Heard, And Our Hearts Are Glad;
For We Were A Lonely Pilgrim Band,
And Weary, And Worn, And Sad.
They Tell Us The Saints Have A Dwelling There-
No Longer Are Homeless Ones;
And We Know That The Goodly Land Is Fair,
Where Life'S Pure River Runs.

2
They Say Green Fields Are Waving There,
That Never A Blight Shall Know;
And The Deserts Wild Are Blooming Fair,
And The Roses Of Sharon Grow.
There Are Lovely Birds In The Bowers Green,
Their Songs Are Blithe And Sweet;
And Their Warblings, Gushing Ever New,
The Angels' Harpings Greet.

3
We Have Heard Of The Palms, The Robes, The Crowns,
And The Silvery Band In White;
Of The City Fair, With Pearly Gates,
All Radiant With Light.
We Have Heard Of The Angels There, And Saints,
With Their Harps Of Gold, How They Sing;
Of The Mount With The Fruitful Tree Of Life,
Of The Leaves That Healing Bring.

4
The King Of That Country, He Is Fair,
He'S The Joy And Light Of The Place;
In His Beauty We Shall Behold Him There,
And Bask In His Smiling Face,
We'Ll Be There, We'Ll Be There In A Little While,
We'Ll Join The Pure And The Blest;
We'Ll Have The Palm, The Robe, The Crown,
And Forever Be At Rest.
