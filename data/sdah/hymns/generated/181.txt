181 - Does Jesus Care


1
Does Jesus Care When My Heart Is Pained
Too Deeply For Mirth And Song;
As The Burdens Press, And The Cares Distress,
And The Way Grows Weary And Long?

Refrain
O Yes, He Cares- I Know He Cares!
His Heart Is Touched With My Grief;
When The Days Are Weary,
The Long Nights Dreary,
I Know My Savior Cares. (He Cares.)

2
Does Jesus Care When My Way Is Dark
With A Nameless Dread And Fear?
As The Daylight Fades Into Deep Night Shades,
Does He Care Enough To Be Near?

3
Does Jesus Care When I'Ve Said Goodbye
To The Dearest On Earth To Me,
And My Sad Heart Aches Till It Nearly Breaks Â­
Is It Aught To Him? Does He See?
