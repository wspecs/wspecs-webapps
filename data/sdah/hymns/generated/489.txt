489 - Jesus, Lover Of My Soul


1
Jesus, Lover Of My Soul,
Let Me To Thy Bosom Fly,
While The Billows Near Me Roll,
While The Tempest Still Is High;
Hide Me, O My Savior, Hide!
Till The Storm Of Life Is Past;
Safe Into The Haven Guide,
O Receive My Soul At Last!

2
Other Refuge Has I None,
Hangs My Helpless Soul On Thee;
Leave O Leave Me Not Alone!
Still Support And Comfort Me;
All My Trust On Thee Is Stayed,
All My Help From Thee I Bring;
Cover My Defenseless Head
With The Shadow Of Thy Wing.

3
Thou, O Christ, All I Want,
More Than All In Thee I Find;
Raise The Fallen, Cheer The Faint,
Heal The Sick, And Lead The Blind.
Just And Holy Is Thy Name,
I Am All Unrighteousness;
Vile And Full Of Sin I Am;
Thou Art Full Of Truth And Grace.

4
Plenteous Grace With Thee Is Found-
Grace To Pardon All My Sin;
Let The Healing Streams Abound,
Make And Keep Me Pure Within;
Thou Of Life The Fountain Art,
Freely Let Me Take Of Thee;
Spring Thou Up Within My Heart,
Rise To All Eternity.
