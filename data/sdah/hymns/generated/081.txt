081 - Though I Speak With Tongues


1
Though I Speak With Tongues Of Men And Angels,
Though I Have The Prophet'S Gift,
Though I Hold The Keys To Hidden Knowledge,
Though My Faith Can Mountains Shift;
Without Love I Am No Better,
Without Love It'S All For Naught;
Lord, You Spent Your Life In Loving Others:
What This Means I Would Be Taught.

2
Love Is Patient, Knows No Envy,
Never Gloats When Others Sin;
Love Is Never Glad To See Injustice,
Always Wants The Truth To Win.
There'S No End To Love'S Endurance,
There'S No Test It Cannot Face;
Lord, You Spent Your Life In Loving Others:
I Shall Fail Without Your Grace.

3
Though There'Ll Be An End To Hidden Knowledge,
Visions, Raptures, Prophecy:
Faith And Hope And Love Shall Last Forever,
Love The Greatest Of The Three.
Without Love I Am No Better,
Without Love It'S All For Naught;
Lord, You Gave Your Life In Saving Others:
What This Means I Would Be Taught.
