157 - Go To Dark Gethsemane


1
Go To Dark Gethsemane,
Ye Who Feel The Tempter'S Power
Your Redeemer'S Conflict See.
Watch With Him One Bitter Hour;
Turn Not From His Griefs Away;
Learn From Jesus Christ To Pray.

2
See Him At The Judgment Hall,
Beaten, Bound, Reviled, Arraigned;
See Him Meekly Bearing All;
Love To Man His Soul Sustained!
Shun Not Suffering, Shame, Or Loss;
Learn From Him To Bear The Cross.

3
Calvary'S Mournful Mountain Climb;
There, Adoring At His Feet,
Mark That Miracle Of Time,
God'S Own Sacrifice Complete.
"It Is Finished!" Hear Him Cry;
Learn From Jesus Christ To Die.
