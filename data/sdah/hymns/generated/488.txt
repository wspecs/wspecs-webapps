488 - At First I Prayed For Light


1
At First I Prayed For Light:
Could I But See The Way,
How Gladly, Swiftly Would I Walk
To Everlasting Day!

2
And Next I Prayed For Strength:
That I Might Tread The Road
With Firm, Unfaltering Feet, And Win
The Heaven'S Serene Abode.

3
And Then I Asked For Faith:
Could I But Trust My God,
I'D Live Infolded In His Peace,
Though Foes Were All Abroad.

4
But Now I Pray For Love:
Deep Love To God And Man;
A Living Love That Will Not Fail,
However Dark His Plan.

5
And Light And Strength And Faith
Are Opening Everywhere!
God Waited Patiently Until
I Prayed The Larger Prayer.
