079 - O Love Of God, How Strong And True!


1
O Love Of God, How Strong And True!
Eternal, And Yet Ever New;
Uncomprehended And Unbought,
Beyond All Knowledge And All Thought.

2
O Love Of God, How Deep And Great,
Far Deeper Than Man'S Deepest Hate;
Self-Fed, Self-Kindled Like The Light,
Changeless, Eternal, Infinite.

3
We Read Thee Best In Him Who Cam
To Bear For Us The Cross Of Shame;
Sent By The Father From On High,
Our Life To Live, Our Death To Die.

4
We Read Thy Power To Bless And Save,
E'En In The Darkness Of The Grave;
Still More In Resurrection Light
We Read The Fullness Of Thy Might.

5
O Love Of God, Our Shield And Stay
Through All The Perils Of Our Way!
Eternal Love, In Thee We Rest,
Forever Safe, Forever Blest.
