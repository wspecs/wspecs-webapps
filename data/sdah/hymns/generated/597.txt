597 - Ye Servants Of The Lord


1
Ye Servants Of The Lord,
Each In His Office Wait,
Observant Of His Heavenly Word,
And Watchful At His Gate.

2
Let All Your Lamps Be Bright,
And Trim The Golden Flame,
Gird Up Your Loins As In His Sight,
His Coming Thus Proclaim.

3
Watch, 'Tis Your Lord'S Command,
And While We Speak He'S Near;
Mark The First Signal Of His Hand,
And Ready All Appear.

4
O Happy Servant, He,
In Such A Posture Found!
He Shall His Lord With Rapture See,
And Be With Honor Crowned.
