316 - Live Out Thy Life Within Me


1
Live Out Thy Life Within Me,
O Jesus, King Of Kings!
Be Thou Thyself The Answer
To All My Questionings;
Live Out Thy Life Within Me,
In All Things Have Thy Way!
I, The Transparent Medium
Thy Glory To Display.

2
The Temple Has Been Yielded,
And Purified Of Sin;
Let Thy Shekinah Glory
Now Shine Forth From Within,
And All The Earth Keep Silence,
The Body Henceforth Be
Thy Silent, Gentle Servant,
Moved Only As By Thee.

3
Its Members Every Moment
Held Subject To Thy Call,
Ready To Have Thee Use Them,
Or Not Be Used At All;
Held Without Restless Longing,
Or Strain, Or Stress, Or Fret
Or Chafings At Thy Dealings,
Or Thoughts Of Vain Regret.

4
But Restful, Calm, And Pliant,
From Bend And Bias Free,
Awaiting Thy Decision,
When Thou Hast Need Of Me.
Live Out Thy Life Within Me,
O Jesus, King Of Kings!
Be Thou The Glorious Answer
To All My Questionings.
