547 - Be Thou My Vision


1
Be Thou My Vision, O Lord Of My Heart;
Naught Be All Else To Me, Save That Thou Art
Thou My Best Thought, By Day Or By Night,
Waking Or Sleeping, Thy Presence My Light.

2
Be Thou My Wisdom, And Thou My True Word;
I Ever With Thee And Thou With Me, Lord;
Thou My Great Father, I Thy True Son;
Thou In Me Dwelling, And I With Thee One.

3
Riches I Heed Not, Nor Man'S Empty Praise,
Thou Mine Inheritance, Now And Always:
Thou And Thou Only, First In My Heart,
High King Of Heaven, My Treasure Thou Art.

4
High King Of Heaven, My Victory Won,
May I Reach Heaven'S Joys, O Bright Heaven'S Sun!
Heart Of My Own Heart, Whatever Befall,
Still Be My Vision, O Ruler Of All.
