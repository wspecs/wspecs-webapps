377 - Go Forth, Go Forth With Christ


1
Go Forth, Go Forth With Christ,
Who Called You To This Day,
He Who Has Led, Will Lead
And Keep You In His Way:
His Word Is Fast, His Promise Sure
To All Who Serve Him And Endure.

2
Go Forth, Go Forth With Christ,
With Purpose Not Your Own,
Each Vict'Ry You Shall Gain
Through Him Your Lord Alone:
To Guard You In Fidelity
His Spirit Shall Your Strength'Ner Be.

3
Go Forth, Go Forth With Christ,
His Priesthood You Shall Share,
Who Bought Us By His Blood
To Be His Servants Here:
Walk In The Way Your Savior Trod,
Go Forth With Him, Go Forth With God.
