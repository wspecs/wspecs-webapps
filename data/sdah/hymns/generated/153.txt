153 - Prince Of Peace, Control My Will


1
Prince Of Peace, Control My Will,
Bid This Struggling Heart Be Still;
Bid My Fears And Doubtings Cease,
Hush My Spirit Into Peace.

2
Thou Hast Bought Me With Thy Blood,
Opened Wide The Gate To God;
Peace, I Ask, But Peace Must Be,
Lord, In Being One With Thee.

3
May Thy Will, Not Mine, Be Done,
May Thy Will And Mine Be One;
Chase These Doubtings From My Heart,
Now Thy Perfect Peace Impart.
