Praise Him Who Loves To See Young Lovers,
Fresh Hearts That Swell With Youthful Pride;
Thank Him Who Sends The Sun Above Us,
As Bridegroom Fit To Meet His Bride;
Praise Him Who Loves To See Young Lovers,
Fresh Hearts That Swell With Youthful Pride.

Praise Him Who By A Simple Flower
Lifts Up Our Hearts To Things Above;
Thank Him Who Gives To Each One Power
To Find A Friend To Know And Love;
Praise Him Who By A Simple Flower
Lifts Up Our Hearts To Things Above.
