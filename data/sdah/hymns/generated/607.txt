607 - God Of Grace And God Of Glory


1
God Of Grace And God Of Glory,
On Thy People Pour Thy Power;
Now Fulfill Thy Church'S Story,
Bring Her Bud To Glorious Flower.
Grant Us Wisdom, Grant Us Courage,
For The Facing Of This Hour.

2
Lo, The Hosts Of Evil Round Us
Scorn Thy Christ, Assail His Ways;
From The Fears That Long Have Bound Us
Free Our Hearts To Faith And Praise.
Grant Us Wisdom, Grant Us Courage,
For The Facing Of This Hour.

3
Cure Thy Children'S Warring Madness,
Bend Our Pride To Thy Control;
Shame Our Wanton Selfish Gladness
Rich In Goods And Poor In Soul.
Grant Us Wisdom, Grant Us Courage,
Lest We Miss Thy Kingdom'S Goal.

4
Set Our Feet On Lofty Places,
Gird Our Lives That They May Be
Armored With All Christ-Like Graces
In The Fight To Set All Free.
Grant Us Wisdom, Grant Us Courage,
That We Fail Not Man Nor Thee.
