087 - God Who Spoke In The Beginning


1
God Who Spoke In The Beginning,
Forming Rock And Shaping Spar,
Set All Life And Growth In Motion,
Earthly World And Distant Star;
He Who Calls The Earth To Order
Is The Ground Of What We Are.

2
God Who Spoke Thro' Men And Nations,
Thro' Events Long Past And Gone,
Showing Still Today His Purpose,
Speaks Supremely Through His Son;
He Who Calls The Earth To Order
Gives His Word And It Is Done.

3
God Whose Speech Becomes Incarnate -
Christ Is Servant, Christ Is Lord -
Calls Us To A Life Of Service,
Heart And Will To Action Stirred;
He Who Uses Man'S Obedience
Has The First And Final Word.
