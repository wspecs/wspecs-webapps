155 - When I Survey The Wondrous Cross


1
When I Survey The Wondrous Cross
On Which The Prince Of Glory Died,
My Richest Gain I Count But Loss,
And Pour Contempt On All My Pride.

2
See, From His Head, His Feet,
Sorrow And Love Flow Mingled Down;
Did E'Er Such Love And Sorrow Meet?
Or Thorns Compose So Rich A Crown?

3
Since I, Who Was Undone And Lost,
Have Pardon Through His Name And Word;
Forbid It, Then, That I Should Boast,
Save In The Cross Of Christ My Lord.

4
Were The Whole Realm Of Nature Mine,
That Were A Tribute Far Too Small;
Love So Amazing, So Divine,
Demands My Life, My Soul, My All.
