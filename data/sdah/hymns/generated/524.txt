524 - Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus


1
'Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus,
And To Take Him At His Word;
Just To Rest Upon His Promise,
And To Know, "Thus Saith The Lord."

Refrain
Jesus, Jesus, How I Trust Him!
How I'Ve Proved Him O'Er And O'Er!
Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
O For Grace To Trust Him More!

2
O How Sweet To Trust In Jesus,
Just To Trust His Cleansing Blood;
And In Simple Faith To Plunge Me
Neath The Healing, Cleansing Flood!

3
Yes, 'Tis Sweet To Trust In Jesus,
Just From Sin And Self To Cease;
Just From Jesus Simply Taking
Life And Rest, And Joy And Peace.

4
I'M So Glad I Learned To Trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I Know That Thou Art With Me,
Wilt Be With Me To The End.
