169 - Come, You Faithful


1
Come, You Faithful, Raise The Strain
Of Triumphant Gladness;
God Has Brought His People
Now Rejoice, Jerusalem,
And With True Affection
Welcome In Unwearied Strains
Jesus'Resurrection.

2
'Tis The Spring Of Souls Today;
Christ Has Burst His Prison
From The Frost And Gloom Of Death
Light And Life Have Risen
All The Winter Of Our Sins,
Long And Dark, Is Flying
From His Ligth, To Whom We Give
Thanks And Praise Undying.

3
"Alleluia!" Now We Cry
To Our King Immortal,
Who, Triumphant, Burst The
Bars Of The Tomb'S Dark Portal
"Alleluia!" With The Son,
God The Father Praising;
"Alleluia!" Yet Again To
The Spirit Raising.
