583 - You That Know The Lord


1
You That Know The Lord Is Gracious,
You For Whom A Cornerstone
Stands, Of God Elect And Precious,
Laid That You May Build There-On,
See That On That Sure Foundation
You A Living Temple Raise.
Towers That May Tell Forth Salvation,
Walls That May Reech-O Praise.

2
Living Stones By God Appointed
Each To His Allotted Place,
Kings And Priests, By God Anointed,
Shall You Not Declare His Grace?
You, A Royal Generation,
Tell The Tidings Of Your Birth,
Tidings Of A New Creation
To An Old And Weary Earth.

3
Tell The Praise Of Him Who Called You
Out Of Darkness Into Light,
Broke The Fetters That Enthralled You,
Gave You Freedom, Peace, And Sight:
Tell The Tale Of Sins Forgiven,
Strength Renewed And Hope Restored,
Till The Earth, In Tune With Heaven,
Praise And Magnify The Lord.
