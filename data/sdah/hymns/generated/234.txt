234 - Christ Is The World'S Light


1
Christ Is The World'S Light,
Christ And None Other;
Born In Our Darkness,
He Became Our Brother-
If We Have Seen Him,
We Have Seen The Father:
Glory To God On High!

2
Christ Is The World'S Peace,
Christ And None Other;
No One Can Serve Him,
And Despise Another.
Who Else Unites Us,
One In God The Father?
Glory To God On High!

3
Christ Is The World'S Life,
Christ And None Other;
Sold Once For Silver,
Murdered Here, Our Brother-
He, Who Redeems Us,
Reigns With God The Father:
Glory To God On High!

4
Give God The Glory,
God And None Other;
Give God The Glory,
Spirit, Son And Father;
Give God The Glory,
God-With-Us Our Brother:
Glory To God On High!
