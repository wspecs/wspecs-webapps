638 - The Wise May Bring Their Learning


1
Wise May Bring Their Learning,
The Rich May Bring Their Wealth,
And Some May Bring Their Greatness,
And Some Their Strength And Health:
We Too Would Bring Our Treasures
To Offer To The King,
We Have No Wealth Or Learning-
What Shall We Children Bring?

2
We'Ll Bring Him Hearts That Love Him,
We'Ll Bring Him Thankful Praise,
And Young Souls Meekly Striving
To Follow In His Ways:
And These Be The Treasures
We Offer To The King,
And These Are Gifts That Ever
The Poorest Child May Bring.

3
We'Ll Bring The Little Duties
We Have To Do Each Day;
We'Ll Try Our Best To Please Him
At Home, At School, At Play:
And Better Are These Treasures
To Offer To The King
Than Richest Gift Without Them:
Yet These A Child May Bring.
