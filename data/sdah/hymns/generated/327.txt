327 - I'D Rather Have Jesus


1
I'D Rather Have Jesus Than Silver Or Gold;
I'D Rather Be His Than Have Riches Untold;
I'D Rather Have Jesus Than Houses Or Land;
I'D Rather Be Led By His Nail-Pierced Hand:

Refrain
Than To Be The King Of A Vast Domain
Or Be Held In Sin'S Dread Sway!
I'D Rather Have Jesus Than Anything
This World Affords Today.

2
I'D Rather Have Jesus Than Men'S Applause;
I'D Rather Be Faithful To His Dear Cause;
I'D Rather Have Jesus Than World-Wide Fame;
I'D Rather Be True To His Holy Name:

3
He'S Fairer Than Lilies Of Rarest Bloom;
He'S Sweeter Than Honey From Out The Comb;
He'S All That My Hungering Spirit Needs -
I'D Rather Have Jesus And Let Him Lead:
