300 - Rock Of Ages


1
Rock Of Ages, Cleft For Me,
Let Me Hide Myself In Thee;
Let The Water And The Blood,
From Thy Riven Side Which Flowed,
Be Of Sin The Double Cure,
Cleanse Me From Its Guilt And Power.

2
Not The Labor Of My Hands
Can Fulfill Thy Law'S Demands;
Could My Zeal No Respite Know,
Could My Tears Forever Flow,
All For Sin Could Not Atone;
Thou Must Save, And Thou Alone.

3
When My Pilgrimage I Close;
Victor O'Er The Last Of Foes,
When I Soar To Worlds Unknown,
And Behold Thee On Thy Throne,
Rock Of Ages, Cleft For Me,
Let Me Hide Myself In Thee.
