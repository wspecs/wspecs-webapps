137 - We Three Kings


1
We Three Kings Of Orient Are;
Bearing Gifts We Traverse Afar
Field And Fountain, Moor And Mountain,
Following Yonder Star.

Refrain
O Star Of Wonder, Star Of Night,
Star With Royal Beauty Bright,
Westward Leading, Still Proceeding,
Guide Us To Thy Perfect Light.

2
Born A King On Bethlehem'S Plain,
Gold I Bring To Crown Him Again,
King Forever, Ceasing Never
Over Us All To Reign.

3
Frankincense To Offer Have I;
Incense Owns A Deity Nigh;
Prayer And Praising All Men Raising,
Worship Him, God On High.

4
Myrrh Is Mine; Its Bitter Perfume
Breathes A Life Of Gathering Gloom:
Sorrowing, Sighing, Bleeding, Dying,
Sealed In The Stonecold Tomb.

5
Glorious Now Behold Him Arise,
King And God And Sacrifice;
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Sounds Through The Earth And Skies.
