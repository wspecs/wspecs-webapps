304 - Faith Of Our Fathers


1
Faith Of Our Fathers, Living Still,
In Spite Of Dungeon, Fire And Sword;
O How Our Hearts Beat High With Joy
Whenever We Hear That Glorious Word!
Faith Of Our Fathers, Holy Faith!
We Will Be True To Thee Till Death.

2
Our Fathers, Chained In Prisons Dark,
Were Still In Heart And Conscience Free:
How Sweet Would Be Their Children'S Fate.
If They, Like Them, Could Die For Thee!
Faith Of Our Fathers, Holy Faith!
We Will Be True To Thee Till Death.

3
Faith Of Our Fathers, We Will Love
Both Friend And Foe In All Our Strife;
And Preach Thee, Too, As Love Knows How
By Kindly Words And Virtuous Life.
Faith Of Our Fathers, Holy Faith!
We Will Be True To Thee Till Death.
