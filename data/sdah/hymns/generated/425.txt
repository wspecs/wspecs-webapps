425 - Holy, Holy, Is What The Angels Sing


1
There Is Singing Up In Heaven
Such As We Have Never Known,
Where The Angels Sing The Praises
Of The Lamb Upon The Throne;
Their Sweet Harps Are Ever Tuneful
And Their Voices Are Always Clear,
O That We Might Be More Like Them
While We Serve The Master Here!

Refrain
Holy, Holy, Is What The Angels Sing,
And I Expect To Help Them Make
The Courts Of Heaven Ring;
But When I Sing Redemption'S Story,
They Will Fold Their Wings,
For Angels Never Felt The Joys
That Our Salvation Brings.

2
But I Hear Another Anthem,
Blending Voices Clear And Strong,
"Unto Him Who Hath Redeemed Us
And Hath Bought Us," Is The Song;
We Have Come Thro' Tribulations
To This Land So Fair And Bright,
In The Fountain Freely Flowing
He Hath Made Our Garments White.

3
Then The Angels Stand And Listen,
For They Cannot Join That Song,
Like The Sound Of Many Waters,
By That Happy, Blood-Washed Throng;
For They Sing About Great Trials,
Battles Fought And Vict'Ries Won,
And They Praised The Great Redeemer,
Who Hath Said To Them, "Well Done."

4
So, Although I'M Not An Angel,
Yet I Know That Over There
I Will Join A Blessed Chorus
That The Angels Cannot Share;
I Will Sing About My Savior,
Who Upon Dark Calvary
Freely Pardoned My Transgressions,
Died To Set The Sinner Free.
