339 - God Is My Strong Salvation


1
God Is My Strong Salvation,
What Foe Have I To Fear?
In Darkness And Temptation,
My Light, My Help, Is Near:
Though Hosts Encamp Around Me,
Firm In The Fight I Stand;
What Terror Can Confound Me,
With God At My Right Hand?

2
Place On The Reliance;
My Soul With Courage Wait;
His Truth Be Thine Affiance,
When Faint And Desolate.
His Might Thy Heart Shall Strengthen,
His Love Thy Joy Increase;
Mercy Thy Days Shall Lengthen;
The Lord Will Give Thee Peace.
