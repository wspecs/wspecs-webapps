552 - The Lord'S My Shepherd


1
The Lord'S My Shepherd, I'Ll Not Want.
He Makes Me Down To Lie
In Pastures Green; He Leadeth Me
The Quiet Waters By.

2
My Soul He Doth Restore Again.
And Me To Walk Doth Make
Within The Paths Of Righteousness,
E'En For His Own Name'S Sake.

3
Yea, Though I Walk In Death'S Dark Vale,
Yet Will I Fear No Ill,
For Thou Art With Me; And Thy Rod
And Staff Me Comfort Still.

4
My Table Thou Hast Furnished
In Presence Of My Foes;
My Head Thou Dost With Oil Anoint,
And My Cup Overflows.

5
Goodness And Mercy All My Life
Shall Surely Follow Me;
And In God'S House Forevermore
My Dwelling Place Shall Be.
