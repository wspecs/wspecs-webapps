269 - Come, Holy Spirit


1
Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove,
With All Thy Quickening Powers;
Kindle A Flame Of Sacred Love
In These Cold Hearts Of Ours.

2
O Raise Our Thoughts From Things Below,
From Vanities And Toys!
Then Shall We With Fresh Courage Go
To Reach Eternal Joys.

3
Awake Our Souls To Joyful Songs;
Let Pure Devotions Rise;
Till Praise Employs Our Thankful Tongues,
And Doubt Forever Dies.

4
Father, We Would No Longer Live
At This Poor, Dying Rate;
To Thee Our Thankful Love We Give,
For Thine To Us Is Great.

5
Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove,
With All Thy Quickening Powers;
Come, Shed Abroad A Savior'S Love,
And That Shall Kindle Ours.
