313 - Just As I Am


1
Just As I Am, Without One Plea,
But That Thy Blood Was Shed For Me,
And That Thou Bidst Me Come To Thee,
O Lamb Of God, I Come, I Come.

2
Just As I Am, And Waiting Not
To Rid My Soul Of One Dark Blot,
To Thee Whose Blood Can Cleanse Each Spot,
O Lamb Of God, I Come, I Come.

3
Just As I Am, Though Tossed About
With Many A Conflict, Many A Doubt,
"Fightings Within, And Fears Without,"
O Lamb Of God, I Come, I Come.

4
Just As I Am, Poor, Wretched, Blind;
Sight, Riches, Healing Of The Mind,
Yea, All I Need In Thee To Find,
O Lamb Of God, I Come, I Come.

5
Just As I Am, Thou Wilt Receive,
Wilt Welcome, Pardon, Cleanse, Relieve;
Because Thy Promise I Believe,
O Lamb Of God, I Come, I Come.

6
Just As I Am, Thy Love I Own
Has Broken Every Barrier Down;
Now, To Be Thine, And Thine Alone,
O Lamb Of God, I Come, I Come.
