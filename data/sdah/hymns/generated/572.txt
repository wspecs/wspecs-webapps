572 - Give Of Your Best To The Master


1
Give Of Your Best To The Master,
Give Of The Strength Of Your Youth;
Throw Your Soul'S Fresh, Glowing Ardor
Into The Battle For Truth.
Jesus Has Set The Example -
Dauntless Was He, Young And Brave;
Give Him Your Loyal Devotion,
Give Him The Best That You Have.

Refrain
Give Of Your Best To The Master,
Give Of The Strength Of Your Youth;
Clad In Salvation'S Full Armor,
Join In The Battle For Truth.

2
Give Of Your Best To The Master,
Give Him First Place In Your Heart;
Give Him First Place In Your Service,
Consecrate Every Part.
Give, And To You Shall Be Given -
God His Beloved Son Gave;
Gratefully Seeking To Serve Him,
Give Him The Best That You Have.

3
Give Of Your Best To The Master,
Naught Else Is Worthy His Love;
He Gave Himself For Your Ransom,
Have Up His Glory Above;
Laid Down His Life Without Murmur,
You From Sin'S Ruin To Save;
Give Him Your Heart'S Adoration,
Give Him The Best That You Have.
