477 - Come, Ye Disconsolate


1
Come, Ye Disconsolate, Where'Er Ye Languish.
Come To The Mercy Seat, Fervently Kneel.
Here Bring Your Wounded Hearts, Here Tell Your Anguish;
Earth Has No Sorrow That Heaven Cannot Heal.

2
Joy Of The Desolate, Light Of The Straying,
Hope Of The Penitent, Fadeless And Pure!
Here Speaks The Comforter, Tenderly Saying,
"Earth Has No Sorrow That Heaven Cannot Cure."

3
Here See The Bread Of Life; Waters Flowing
Forth From The Throne Of God, Pure From Above.
Come To The Feast Of Love; Come, Ever Knowing
Earth Has No Sorrow But Heaven Can Remove.
