384 - Safely Through Another Week

Safely Through Another Week
God Has Brought Us On Our Way;
Let Us Now A Blessing Seek,
Waiting In His Courts Today;
Day Of All The Week The Best,
Emblem Of Eternal Rest:
Day Of All The Week The Best,
Emblem Of Eternal Rest.

While We Seek Supplies Of Grace,
Thro' The Dear Redeemer'S Name,
Show Thy Reconciling Face;
Take Away The Sin And Shame:
From Our Worldly Cares Set Free,
May We Rest This Day In Thee:
From Our Worldly Cares Set Free,
May We Rest This Day In Thee.

When The More Shall Bid Us Rise,
May We Feel Thy Presence Near;
May Thy Glory Meet Our Eyes,
While We In Thy House Appear:
Here Afford Us, Lord, A Taste
Of Our Everlasting Feast:
Here Afford Us, Lord, A Taste
Of Our Everlasting Feast.

4
May The Gospel'S Joyful Sound
Conquer Sinners, Comfort Saints;
Make The Fruits Of Grace Abound,
Bring Relief To All Complaints:
Thus May All Our Sabbaths Be,
Till We We Rise To Reign With Thee.
Thus May All Our Sabbaths Be,
Till We We Rise To Reign With Thee.
