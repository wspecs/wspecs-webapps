511 - I Know Whom I Have Believed


1
I Know Not Why God'S Wondrous Grace
To Me He Hath Made Known,
Nor Why, Unworthy, Christ In Love
Redeemed Me For His Own.

Refrain
But "I Know Whom I Have Believed,
And Am Persuaded That His Is Able
To Keep That Which I'Ve Committed
Unto Him Against That Day."

2
I Know Not How This Saving Faith
To Me He Did Impart,
Nor How Believing In His Word
Wrought Peace Within My Heart.

3
I Know Not How The Spirit Moves,
Convincing Men Of Sin,
Revealing Jesus Through The Word,
Creating Faith In Him.

4
I Know Not When My Lord May Come,
At Night Or Noonday Fair,
Nor If I Walk The Vale With Him,
Or Meet Him In The Air.
