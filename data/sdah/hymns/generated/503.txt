503 - A Quiet Place


1
There Is A Quiet Place,
Far From The Rapid Pace
Where God Can Soothe My Troubled Mind.
Sheltered By Tree And Flow'R,
There In My Quiet Hour
With Him My Cares Are Left Behind.
Whether A Garden Small,
Or On A Mountain Tall,
New Strength And Courage There I Find;
Then From This Quiet Place
I Go Prepared To Face A New Day
With Love For All Mankind.
