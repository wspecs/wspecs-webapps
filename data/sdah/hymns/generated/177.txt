177 - Jesus, Your Blood And Righteousness


1
Jesus, Your Blood And Righteousness
My Beauty Are, My Glorious Dress;
Mid Flaming Worlds, In These Arrayed,
With Joy Shall I Lift Up My Head.

2
Bold Shall I Stand In That Great Day,
Cleansed And Redeemed, No Debt To Pay;
For By Your Cross Absolved I Am
From Sin And Guilt, From Fear And Shame.

3
Lord, I Believe Your Precious Blood,
Which At The Mercy Seat Of God
Pleads For The Captives' Liberty,
Was Also Shed In Love For Me.

4
When From The Dust Of Death I Rise
To Claim My Mansion In The Skies,
This Then Shall Be My Only Plea:
Christ Jesus Lived And Died For Me.
