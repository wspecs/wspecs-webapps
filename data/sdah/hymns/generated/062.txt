062 - How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling Place


1
How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling Place,
O Lord Of Hosts To Me!
The Tabenacles Of Thy Grace
How Pleasant, Lord, They Be!

2
My Thirsty Soul Longs Ardently,
Yea, Faints Thy Courts To See;
My Very Heart And Flesh Cry Out,
O Living God, For Thee.

3
Behold The Sparrow Findeth Out
A House Where-In To Rest;
The Swallow Also, For Herself
Provided Hath A Nest.

4
Ev'N Thine Own Altars, Where She Safe
Her Young Ones Forth May Bring,
O Thou, Almighty Lord Of Hosts,
Who Art My God And King.

5
Blest Are They In Thy House That Dwell,
They Ever Give Thee Praise.
Blest Is The Man Whose Strength Thou Art,
In Whose Heart Are Thy Ways.
