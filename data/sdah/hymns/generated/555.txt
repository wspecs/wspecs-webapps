555 - Shepherd Of Tender Youth


1
Shepherd Of Tender You,
Guiding In Love And Truth,
Through Devious Way;
Christ Our Triumphant King,
We Come Thy Name To Sin,
Hither Our Children Bring
To Shout Thy Praise.

2
Thou Are Our Holy Lord,
Thee All Subduing Word,
Healer Of Strife;
Thou Didst Thyself Abase,
That From Sin'S Deep Disgrace
Thou Mightest Save Our Race,
And Give Us Life.

3
Thou Are The Great High Priest;
Thou Has Prepared The Feast
Of Heavenly Love;
While In Our Mortal Pain
None Call On Thee In Vain;
Help Thou Does Not Disdain,
Help From Above.

4
Ever Be Thou Our Guide,
Our Shepherd And Our Pride,
Our Staff And Song;
Jesus, Thou Christ Of God,
By Thy Perennial Word,
Lead Us Where Thou Hast Trod,
Make Our Faith Strong.
