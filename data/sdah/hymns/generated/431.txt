431 - Over Yonder


1
Come Let Us Sing Of Homeland,
Down By The Crystal Sea;
Wonderful Land Where Jesus
Buildeth A Mansion For Me.

Refrain
Over Yonder, Down By The Crystal Sea,
Down              By The Crystal Sea,
Over Yonder, There'S Where I Long To Be,
There'S            Where I Long To Be,
No More Sorrow, Toil, Grief, Nor Care,
In The Homeland Bright And Fair,
Over, Over There.
Over There.

2
Water Of Life There Floweth,
Fruit In Abundant Store;
Citizens Of That Country
Hunger And Thirst Never More.

3
Come Go With Me To Homeland,
Jesus Invites You There;
Help Spread The Invitation,
Tell It To Men Everywhere.
