Hark! Ten Thousand Harps And Voices
Sound The Note Of Praise Above;
Jesuse Reigns, And Heaven Rejoices,
Jesus Reigns, The God Of Love:
See, He Sits On Yonder Throne;
Jesus Rules The World Alone.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Amen.

2
King Of Glory, Reign Forever,
Thine An Everlasting Crown;
Nothing From Thy Love Shall Sever
Those Whom Thou Hast Made Thine Own;
Happy Objects Of Thy Grace,
Destined To Behold Thy Face.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Amen.

3
Savior, Hasten Thine Appearing;
Bring, O Bring The Glorious Day,
When, The Awful Summons Hearing,
Heaven And Earth Shall Pass Away:;
Then, With Golden Harps We'Ll Sing,
"Glory, Glory To Our King!"
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Amen.
