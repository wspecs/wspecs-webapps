392 - Dear Lord, We Come At Set Of Sun


1
Dear Lord, We Come At Set Of Sun,
And At Your Feet We Kneel
To Worship You, Creator, King,
This Day, Your Sign And Seal.

2
Our Earthly Tasks We Lay Aside,
According To Your Word,
To Enter Now Your Holy Rest,
The Sabbath Of The Lord.

3
Sweet Sabbath Rest, Your Sacred Hours
Are As A Golden Chain
That Reaches Back To Eden'S Gate
And Points Us Home Again.

4
And When This Earth Shall Be Renewed,
And Sin And Death Destroyed,
Shall All Redeemed Each Sabbath Day
Still Meet To Praise Their God.
