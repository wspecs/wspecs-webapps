119 - Angels From The Realms Of Glory


1
Angels From The Realms Of Glory,
Wing Your Flight O`Er All The Earth;
Ye, Who Sang Creation`S Story,
Now Proclaim Messiah`S Birth;
Come And Worship, Come And Worship,
Worship Christ, The Newborn King.

2
Shepherds, In The Field Abiding,
Watching O`Er Your Flocks By Night,
God With Man Is Now Residing;
Yonder Shines The Infant Light;
Come And Worship, Come And Worship,
Worship Christ, The Newborn King.

3
Sages, Leave Your Contemplations,
Brighter Visions Beam Afar;
Seek The Great Desire Of Nations;
Ye Have Seen His Natal Star;
Come And Worship, Come And Worship,
Worship Christ, The Newborn King.

4
Saints, Before The Altar Bending,
Watching Long In Hope And Fear,
Suddenly The Lord, Descending,
In His Temple Shall Appear;
Come And Worship, Come And Worship,
Worship Christ, The Newborn King.
