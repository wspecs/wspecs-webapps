238 - How Sweet The Name!


1
How Sweet The Name Of Jesus Sounds
In A Believer'S Ear!
It Soothes His Sorrows, Heals His Wounds,
And Drives Away His Fear.

2
It Makes The Wounded Spirit Whole,
And Calms The Troubled Breast;
"Tis Manna To The Hungry Soul,
And To The Weary, Rest.

3
Dear Name, The Rock On Which I Build,
My Shield And Hiding Place,
My Neverfailing Treasury, Filled
With Boundless Stores Of Grace.

4
Jesus! My Shepherd, Guardian, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, And King!
My Lord, My Life, My Way, My End!
Accept The Praise I Bring.

5
Weak Is The Effort Of My Heart,
And Cold My Warmest Thought;
But When I See Thee As Thou Art,
I'Ll Praise Thee As I Ought.
