411 - The Son Of God Proclaim


1
The Son Of God Proclaim,
The Lord Of Time And Space;
The God Who Bade The Light Break Forth
Now Shines In Jesus' Face.

2
Behold His Out Stretched Hands,
Though All Was In His Power
He Took The Towel And Basin Then,
And Serves Us In This Hour.

3
He, God'S Creative Word,
The Church'S Lord And Head,
Here Bids Us Gather As His Friends,
And Share His Wine And Bread.

4
The Lord Of Life And Death
With Wondering Praise We Sing;
We Break The Bread At His Command,
And Name Him God And King.

5
We Take This Cup In Hope:
For He, Who Gladly Bore
The Shameful Cross, Is Ris'N Again,
And Reigns Forevermore.
