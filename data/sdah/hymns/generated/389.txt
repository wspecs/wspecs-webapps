389 - Light Of Light, Enlighten Me


1
Light Of Light, Enlighten Me,
Now Anew The Day Is Dawning;
Sun Of Grace, The Shadows Flee;
Brighten Thou My Sabbath Morning;
With Thy Joyous Sunshine Blest,
Happy Is My Day Of Rest.

2
Let Me With My Heart Today,
Holy, Holy, Holy, Singing,
Rapt Awhile From Earth Away,
All My Soul To Thee Up Springing,
Have A Foretaste Inward Given
How They Worship Thee In Heaven.

3
Hence All Care, All Vanity!
For The Day To God Is Holy;
Come, Thou Glorious Majesty,
Deign To Fill This Temple Lowly;
Nought Today My Soul Shall Move,
Simply Resting In Thy Love.
