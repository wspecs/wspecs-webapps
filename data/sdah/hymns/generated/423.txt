423 - Glorious Things Of Thee Are Spoken


1
Glorious Things Of Thee Are Spoken,
Zion, City Of Our God;
He Whose Word Cannot Be Broken
Formed Thee For His Own Abode;
On The Rock Of Ages Founded,
What Can Shake Thy Sure Repose?
With Salvation'S Wall Surrounded,
Thou Mayest Smile At All Thy Foes.

2
See The Streams Of Living Waters
Springing From Eternal Love,
Well Supply Thy Sons And Daughters,
And All Fear And Want Remove;
Who Can Faint When Such A River
Ever Flows Their Thirst To Assuage?
Grace, Which, Like The Lord, The Giver,
Never Fails From Age To Age.

3
Round Each Habitation Hovering,
See The Cloud And Fire Appear
For A Glory And A Covering,
Showing That The Lord Is Near;
Blest Inhabitants Of Zion,
Washed In The Redeemer'S Blood;
Jesus, Whom Their Souls Rely On,
Makes Them Kings And Priests To God.

4
Savior, If Of Zion'S City
I, Through Grace, A Member Am,
Let The World Deride Or Pity,
I Will Glory In Thy Name;
Fading Is The Worldling'S Pleasure,
All His Boasted Pomp And Show;
Solid Joys And Lasting Treasure
None But Zion'S Children Know.
