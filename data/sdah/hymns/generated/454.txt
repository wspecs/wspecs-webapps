454 - Don'T You See My Jesus Coming


1
Don'T You See My Jesus Coming,
See Him Come In Yonder Cloud?
With Ten Thousand Angels Round Him,
How They Do My Jesus Crowd!

Refrain
I Am Bound For The Kingdom,
Will You Go To Glory With Me?
Hallelujah! O Praise Ye The Lord!

2
Don'T You See The Saints Ascending,
Hear Them Shouting Thro' The Air.
Jesus Smiling, Trumpets Sounding,
Now His Glory They Shall Share.
