100 - Great Is Thy Faithfulness


1
Great Is Thy Faithfulness, O God My Father;
There Is No Shadow Of Turning With Thee;
Thou Changest Not, Thy Compassions, They Fail Not;
As Thou Hast Been, Thou Forever Will Be.

Refrain
Great Is Thy Faithfulness!
Great Is Thy Faithfulness!
Morning By Morning New Mercies I See.
All I Have Needed Thy Hand Hath Provided;
Great Is Thy Faithfulness, Lord, Unto Me!

2
Summer And Winter And Springtime And Harvest,
Sun, Moon And Stars In Their Courses Above
Join With All Nature In Manifold Witness
To Thy Great Faithfulness, Mercy And Love.

3
Pardon For Sin And A Peace That Endureth
Thine Own Dear Presence To Cheer And To Guide;
Strength For Today And Bright Hope For Tomorrow,
Blessings All Mine, With Ten Thousand Beside!
