163 - At The Cross


1
Alas! And Did My Savior Bleed,
And Did My Sovereign Die?
Would He Devote That Sacred Head
For Sinners Such As I?

Refrain
At The Cross, At The Cross,
Where I First Saw The Light,
And The Burden Of My Heart Rolled Away;
It Was There By Faith I Received My Sight,
And Now I Am Happy All The Day!

2
Was It For Crimes That I Have Done,
He Groaned Upon The Tree?
Amazing Pity! Grace Unknown!
And Love Beyond Degree!

3
But Drops Of Grief Can Ne'Er Repay
The Debt Of Love I Owe:
Here, Lord, I Give Myself Away;
'Tis All That I Can Do!
