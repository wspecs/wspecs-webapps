217 - The Church Has Waited Long


1
The Church Has Waited Long
Her Absent Lord To See;
And Still In Loneliness She Waits,
A Friendless Stranger She.

2
How Long, O Lord Our God,
Holy And True And Good,
Wilt Thou Not Judge Thy Suffering Church,
Her Sighs And Tears And Blood?

3
We Long To Hear Thy Voice,
To See Thee Face To Face,
To Share Thy Crown And Glory Then,
As Now We Share Thy Grace.

4
Come, Lord, And Wipe Away
The Curse, The Sin, The Stain,
And Make This Blighted World Of Ours
Thine Own Fair World Again.
