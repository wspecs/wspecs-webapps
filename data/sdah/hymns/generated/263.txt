263 - Fire Of God, Thou Sacred Flame


1
Fire Of God, Thou Sacred Flame,
Spirit Who In Splendor Came,
Let Thy Heat My Soul Refine
Till It Glows With Love Divine.

2
Breath Of God, That Swept In Power
In The Pentecostal Hour,
Holy Breath, Be Thou In Me
Source Of Vital Energy.

3
Strength Of God, Thy Might Within
Conquers Sorrow, Pain, And Sin:
Fortify From Evil'S Art
All The Gateways Of My Heart.

4
Truth Of God, Thy Piercing Rays
Penetrate My Secret Ways.
May The Light That Shames My Sin
Guide Me Holier Paths To Win.

5
Love Of God, Thy Grace Profound
Knoweth Neither Age Nor Bound:
Come, My Heart'S Own Guest To Be,
Dwell Forevermore In Me.
