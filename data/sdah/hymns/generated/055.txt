055 - Jesus, Tender Shepherd, Hear Me


1
Jesus, Tender Shepherd, Hear Me,
Bless Thy Little Lamb Tonight;
Through The Darkness Be Thou Near Me;
Watch My Sleep Till Morning Light.

2
All This Day Thy Hand Has Led Me,
And I Thank Thee For Thy Care;
Thou Hast Clothed Me, Warmed And Fed Me;
Listen To My Evening Prayer.
