647 - Mine Eyes Have Seen The Glory


1
Mine Eyes Have Seen The Glory
Of The Coming Of The Lord;
He Is Trampling Out The Vintage
Where The Grapes Of Wrath Are Stored;
He Has Loosed The Fateful Lightning
Of His Terrible Swift Sword;
His Truth Is Marching On.

Refrain
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His Truth Is Marching On.

2
He Has Sounded Forth The Trumpet
That Shall Never Call Retreat;
He Is Sifting Out The Hearts
Of Men Before His Judgment Seat;
O Be Swift, My Soul, To Answer Him!
Be Jubilant, My Feet!
Our God Is Marching On.

3
In The Beauty Of The Lilies Christ
Was Born Across The Sea,
With A Glory In His Bosom
That Transfigures You And Me;
As He Died To Make Men Holy,
Let Us Live To Make Men Free!
While God Is Marching On.
