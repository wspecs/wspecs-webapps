378 - Go, Preach My Gospel


1
"Go, Preach My Gospel," Saith The Lord;
"Bid The Whole World My Grace Receive;
He Shall Be Saved Who Trusts My Word,
And They Condemned Who Disbelieve.

2
"I'Ll Make Your Great Commission Known,
And Ye Shall Prove My Gospel True
By All The Works That I Have Done,
By All The Wonders Ye Shall Do.

3
"Teach All The Nations My Commands;
I'M With You Till The World Shall End;
All Power Is Vested In My Hands;
I Can Destroy, And I Defend."

4
He Spake, And Light Shone Round His Head;
On A Bright Cloud To Heaven He Rode;
They To The Farthest Nations Spread
The Grace Of Their Ascended Lord.
