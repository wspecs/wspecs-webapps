003 - God Himself Is With Us


1
God Himself Is With Us;
Let Us All Adore Him,
And With Awe Appear Before Him.
God Is Here Within Us;
Soul, In Silence Fear Him,
Humbly, Fervently Draw Near Him.
Now His Own Who Have Known God,
In Worship Lowly,
Yield Their Spirits Wholly.

2
Come, Abide Within Me;
Let My Soul, Like Mary,
Be Thine Earthly Sanctuary.
Come, Indwelling Spirit,
With Transfigured Splendor;
Love And Honor Will I Render.
Where I Go Here Below,
Let Me Bow Before Thee,
Know Thee And Adore Thee.

3
Gladly We Surrender
Earth'S Deceitful Treasures,
Pride Of Life And Sinful Pleasures:
Gladly, Lord, We Offer
Thine To Be Forever,
Soul And Life And Each Endeavor.
Thou Alone Shall Be Known
Lord Of All Our Being,
Life'S True Way Decreeing.
