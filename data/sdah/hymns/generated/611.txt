611 - Awake, My Soul!


1
Awake, My Soul! Stretch Every Nerve,
And Press With Vigor On;
A Heavenly Race Demands Thy Zeal,
And An Immortal Crown.

2
'Tis God'S All Animating Voice
That Calls Thee From On High;
'Tis He Whose Hand Presents The Prize
To Thine Aspiring Eye.

3
A Cloud Of Witnesses Around
Hold Thee In Full Survey;
Forget The Steps Already Trod,
And Onward Urge Thy Way.

4
Blest Savior, Introduced By Thee,
Our Race Have We Begun;
And, Crowned With Victory, At Thy Feet
We'Ll Lay Our Trophies Down.
