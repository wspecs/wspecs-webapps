175 - Now The Green Blade Rises


1
Now The Green Blade Rises From The Buried Grain,
What That In Dark Earth Many Days Has Lain;
Love Lives Again, That With The Dead Has Been;
Love Is Come Again Like Wheat Arising Green.

2
In The Grave They Laid Him, Love By Hatred Slain,
Thinking That He Would Never Wake Again,
Laid In The Earth Like Grain That Sleeps Unseen;
Love Is Come Again Like Wheat Arising Green.

3
Forth He Came In Triumph, Like The Risen Grain,
He That For Three Days In The Grave Had Lain;
Raised From The Dead, My Living Lord Is Seen;
Love Is Come Again Like Wheat Arising Green.

4
When Our Hearts Are Wintry, Grieving, Or In Pain,
Your Touch Can Call Us Back To Life Again,
Field Of Our Hearts That Dead And Bare Have Been;
Love Is Come Again Like Wheat Arising Green.
