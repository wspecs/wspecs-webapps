005 - All My Hope On God Is Founded


1
All My Hope On God Is Founded;
He Doth Still My Trust Renew.
Me Through Change And Chance He Guideth,
Only Good And Only True.
God Unknown, He Alone
Calls My Heart To Be His Own.

2
Pride Of Man And Earthly Glory,
Sword And Crown Betray His Trust;
What With Care And Toil He Buildeth,
Tower And Temple Fall To Dust.
But God'S Power, Hour By Hour,
Is My Temple And My Tower.

3
God'S Great Goodness Aye Endureth,
Deep His Wisdom, Passing Thought;
Splendor, Light And Life Attend Him,
Beauty Springeth Out Of Naught.
Love Doth Stand At His Hand;
Joy Doth Wait On His Command.

4
Still From Man To God Eternal,
Sacrifice Of Praise Be Done.
High Above All Praises Praising,
For The Gift Of Christ His Son.
Christ Doth Call One And All:
Ye Who Follow Shall Not Fall.
