387 - Come, O Sabbath Day


1
Peace And Healing On Thy Wing;
And To Every Troubled Breast
Speak Of The Divine Behest:
Thou Shalt Rest, Thou Shalt Rest!

2
Earthly Longings Bid Retire,
Quench The Passions' Hurtful Fire;
To The Wayward, Sin Oppressed,
Bring Thou Thy Divine Behest:
Thou Shalt Rest, Thou Shalt Rest!

3
Wipe From Every Cheek The Tear,
Banish Care And Silence Fear;
All Things Working For The Best,
Teach Us The Divine Behest:
Thou Shalt Rest, Thou Shalt Rest!
