458 - More Love To Thee


1
More Love To Thee, O Christ, More Love To Thee!
Hear Thou The Prayer I Make On Bended Knee.
This Is My Earnest Plea:
More Love, O Christ, To Thee;
More Love To Thee, More Love To Thee!

2
Once Earthly Joy I Craved, Sought Peace And Rest;
Now Thee Alone I Seek, Give What Is Best.
This All My Prayer Shall Be:
More Love, O Christ, To Thee;
More Love To Thee, More Love To Thee!

3
Let Sorrow Do Its Work, Come Grief And Pain;
Sweet Are Thy Messengers, Sweet Their Refrain,
When They Can Sing With Me:
More Love, O Christ, To Thee;
More Love To Thee, More Love To Thee!

4
Then Shall My Latest Breath Whisper Thy Praise;
This Be The Parting Cry My Heart Shall Raise;
This Still Its Prayer Shall Be:
More Love, O Christ, To Thee;
More Love To Thee, More Love To Thee!
