219 - When Jesus Comes In Glory


1
When Jesus Comes In Glory,
As Lord And King Of Kings,
O What A Wondrous Story
The Blessed Bible Brings:
His Face Will Shine Like The Sunlight,
His Head Be White As Snow,
His Eyes Like Flaming Firelight,
His Feet Like Brass Aglow.

2
His Voice Like Rushing Waters
Will Reach With Mighty Sound
Into The Deepest Quarters
Of All Creation Round;
And At This Wondrous Greeting
The Dead In Christ Shall Rise,
Their Lord And Saviour Meeting
In Glory In The Skies.

3
And We Who Believing
And His Appearing Love,
Shall Know We Are Receiving
His Glory From Above;
His Resurrection Power
Will Raise Us To The Place
Where We That Wondrous Hour
Shall See Him Face To Face.

4
O Hasten Thine Appearing
Thou Bright And Morning Star!
Lord, May We Soon Be Hearing
The Trumpet Sound Afar;
They People All Are Yearning
To Be Thy Raptured Bride,
To Be Thy Own Returning
Be Caught Up To Thy Side.
