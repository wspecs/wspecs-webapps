281 - I Gave My Life For Thee


1
I Gave My Life For Thee,
My Precious Blood I Shed,
That Thou Might'St Ransom Be,
And Quickened From The Dead;
I Gave, I Gave My Life For Thee,
What Hast Thou Given For Me?
I Gave, I Gave My Life For Thee,
What Hast Thou Given For Me?

2
My Fathers House Of Light,
My Glory Circled Throne,
I Left For Earthly Night,
For Wanderings Sad And Lone;
I Left, I Left It All For Thee,
Hast Thou Left Aught For Me?
I Left, I Left It All For Thee,
Hast Thou Left Aught For Me?

3
I Suffered Much For Thee,
More Than Thy Tongue Can Tell,
Of Bitterest Agony,
To Rescue Thee From Hell;
I'Ve Borne, I'Ve Borne It All For Thee,
What Hast Thou Borne For Me?
I'Ve Borne, I'Ve Borne It All For Thee,
What Hast Thou Borne For Me?
