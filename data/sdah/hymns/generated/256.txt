256 - Ye Servants Of God


1
Ye Servants Of God, Your Master Proclaim,
And Publish Abroad His Wonderful Name;
The Name All-Victorious Of Jesus Extol,
His Kingdom Is Glorious And Rules Over All.

2
God Ruleth On High, Almighty To Save,
And Still He Is Nigh, His Presence We Have;
The Great Congregation His Triumph Shall Sing,
Ascribing Salvation To Jesus, Our King.

3
"Salvation To God, Who Sits On The Throne!"
Let All Cry Aloud And Honor The Son;
The Praises Of Jesus The Angels Proclaim,
Fall Down On Their Faces And Worship The Lamb.

4
Then Let Us Adore And Give Him His Right,
All Glory And Power, All Wisdom And Might;
All Honor And Blessing With Angels Above,
And Thanks Never Ceasing And Infinite Love.
