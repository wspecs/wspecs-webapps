533 - O For A Faith


1
O, For A Faith That Will Not Shrink,
Though Pressed By Many A Foe,
That Will Not Tremble On The Brink Of Poverty,
Of Poverty Or Woe; Of Poverty Or Woe;

2
That Will Not Murmur Or Complain
Beneath The Chastening Rod,
But In The Hour Of Grief Or Pain,
Of Grief Or Pain
Can Lean Upon Its God; Can Lean Upon Its God.

3
A Faith That Shines More Bright And Clear
When Tempests Rage Without;
That When In Danger Knows No Fear,
Knows Of No Fear,
In Darkness Feels No Doubt; In Darkness Feels No Doubt.

4
That Bears Unmoved The World'S Dread Frown,
Nor Heeds Its Scornful Smile;
That Sin'S Wild Ocean Cannot Drown,
No, Cannot Drown,
Nor Its Soft Arts Beguile; Nor Its Soft Arts Beguile.

5
Lord, Give Me Such A Faith As This,
And Then, Whate'Er May Come
I'Ll Taste, E'En Here The Hallowed Bliss,
The Hallowed Bliss
Of An Eternal Home; Of An Eternal Home.
