409 - Jesus Invites His Saints


1
Jesus Invites His Saints
To Meet Around His Board,
And Sup In Memory Of The Death
And Sufferings Of Their Lord.

2
We Take The Bread And Wine
As Emblems Of Thy Death;
Lord, Raise Our Souls Above The Sign,
To Feast On Thee By Faith.

2
Faith Eats The Bread Of Life,
And Drinks The Living Wine;
It Looks Beyond This Scene Of Strife
Unites Us To The Vine.

4
Soon Shall The Night Be Gone,
Our Lord Will Come Again;
The Marriage Supper Of The Lamb
Will Usher In His Reign.
