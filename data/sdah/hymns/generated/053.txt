053 - All Praise To Thee


1
All Praise To Thee, My God, This Night,
For All The Blessings Of The Light!
Keep Me, O Keep Me, King Of Kings,
Beneath Thine Own Almighty Wings.

2
Forgive Me, Lord, For Thy Dear Son,
The Ill That I This Day Have Done,
That With The World, Myself, And Thee,
I, Ere I Sleep, At Peace May Be.

3
O May My Soul On Thee Repose,
And With Sweet Sleep Mine Eyelids Close,
Sleep That May Me More Vigorous Make
To Serve My God When I Awake.

4
Praise God, From Whom All Blessings Flow;
Praise Him, All Creatures Here Below;
Praise Him Above, Ye Heavenly Host;
Praise Father, Son, And Holy Ghost.
