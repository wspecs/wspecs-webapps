437 - I'M Going Home


1
My Heav'Nly Home Is Bright And Fair,
Nor Pain Nor Death Can Enter There;
It'S Glitt'Ring Tow'Rs The Sun Outshine,
That Heav'Nly Mansion Shall Me Mine.

Refrain
I'M Going Home, I'M Going Home,
I'M Going Home To Die No More;
To Die No More; To Die No More-
I'M Going Home To Die No More.

2
My Father'S House Is Built On High,
Far, Far Above The Starry Sky;
When From This Earthly Prison Free,
That Heav'Nly Mansion Mine Shall Be.

3
Let Others Seek A Home Below,
Which Flames Devour Or Waves Oe'R Flow;
Be Mine A Happier Lot To Own
A Heav'Nly Mansion Near The Throne.
