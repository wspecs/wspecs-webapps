142 - Angels We Have Heard On High


1
Angels We Have Heard On High
Sweetly Singing O'Er The Plains,
And The Mountains In Reply
Echoing Their Joyous Strains.

Refrain
Gloria, In Excelsis Deo!
Gloria, In Excelsis Deo!

2
Shepherds, Why This Jubilee?
Why Your Joyous Strains Prolong?
What The Gladsome Tidings Be
Which Inspire Your Heavenly Song?

3
Come To Bethlehem And See
Christ Whose Birth The Angels Sing;
Come, Adore On Bended Knee,
Christ The Lord, The Newborn King.

4
See Him In A Manger Laid,
Whom The Choirs Of Angels Praise;
Mary, Joseph, Lend Your Aid,
While Our Hearts In Love We Raise.
