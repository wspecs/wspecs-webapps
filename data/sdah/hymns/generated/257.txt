257 - Come Down, O Love Divine


1
Come Down, O Love Divine, Seek Thou This Soul Of Mine
And Visit It With Thine Own Ardor Glowing;
O Comforter, Draw Near, Within My Heart Appear,
And Kindle It, Thy Holy Flame Bestowing.

2
O Let It Freely Burn, Till Earthly Passions Turn
To Dust And Ashes In Its Heat Consuming;
And Let Thy Glorious Light Shine Ever On My Sight,
And Clothe Me Round, The While My Path Illuming.

3
Let Holy Charity Mine Outward Vesture Be,
And Lowliness Become My Inner Clothing;
True Lowliness Of Heart Which Takes The Humbler Part,
And O'Er Its Own Shortcomings Weeps With Loathing.

4
And So The Yearning Strong With Which The Soul Will Long
Shall Far Outpass The Power Of Human Telling;
For None Can Guess Its Grace, Till Love Create A Place
Wherein The Holy Spirit Makes A Dwelling.
