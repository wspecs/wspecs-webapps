474 - Take The Name Of Jesus With You


1
Take The Name Of Jesus With You,
Child Of Sorrow And Of Woe,
It Will Joy And Comfort Give You;
Take It Then, Where'Er You Go.

Refrain
Precious Name, O How Sweet!
Hope Of Earth And Joy Of Heav'N.
Precious Name, O How Sweet!
Hope Of Earth And Joy Of Heav'N.

2
Take The Name Of Jesus Ever,
As A Shield From Every Snare;
If Temptations Round You Gather,
Breathe That Holy Name In Prayer.

3
O The Precious Name Of Jesus!
How It Thrills Our Souls With Joy,
When His Loving Arms Receive Us,
And His Songs Our Tongues Employ!

4
At The Name Of Jesus Bowing,
Falling Prostrate At His Feet,
King Of Kings In Heav'N We'Ll Crown Him,
When Our Journey Is Complete.
