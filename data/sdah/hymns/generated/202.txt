202 - Hail Him The King Of Glory


1
Tell It To Every Kindred And Nation,
Tell It Far And Near;
Earth'S Darkest Night Will Fade With The Dawning,
Jesus Will Soon Appear.

Refrain
Hail Him The King Of Glory,
Once The Lamb For Sinners Slain;
Tell, Tell The Wondrous Story,
"Jesus Comes To Reign."

2
Nations Again In Strife And Commotion,
Warnings By The Way;
Signs In The Heavens, Unerring Omens,
Herald The Glorious Day.

3
Children Of God Look Up With Rejoicing;
Shout And Sing His Praise;
BlessÃ¨D Are They Who, Waiting And Watching,
Look For The Dawning Rays.
