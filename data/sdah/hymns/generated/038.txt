038 - Arise, My Soul, Arise!


1
Arise, My Soul, Arise!
Stretch Forth To Things Eternal
And Hasten To The Feet Of Your Redeemer God.
Though Hid From Mortal Eyes,
He Dwells In Light Supernal;
Yet Worship Him In Humbleness And Call Him Lord.
His Banquet Of Love
Awaits You Above;
Yet Here He Grants A Foretaste Of The Feast
To Come!
Rejoice, My Soul, Rejoice,
To Heav'N Lift Up Your Voice:
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!

2
Now Hear The Harps Of Heav'N!
Oh, Hear The Song Victorious,
The Never-Ending Anthem Sounding
Through The Sky!
To Mortals Is Not Giv'N
To Join In Strains So Glorious;
Yet Here On Earth We Too Can Sing
Our Praises High!
He Bought With His Blood
The Ransomed Of God;
To Him Be Everlasting Pow'R And Victory.
And Let The Great Amen
Resound Through Heav'N Again.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!
