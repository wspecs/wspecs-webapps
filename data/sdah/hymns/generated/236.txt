236 - I Love Thee


1
I Love Thee, I Love Thee, I Love Thee,My Lord;
I Love Thee, My Savior, I Love Thee, My God.
I Love Thee, I Love Thee, And That Thou Dost Know;
But How Much I Love Thee My Actions Will Show.

2
I'M Happy, I'M Happy, O, Wondrous Account!
My Joys Are Immortal, I Stand On The Mount!
I Gaze On My Treasure And Long To Be There,
With Jesus And Angels, And Kindred So Dear.

3
O Jesus, My Savior, With Thee I Am Blest,
My Life And Salvation, My Joy And My Rest:
Thy Name Be My Theme, And Thy Love Be My Song;
Thy Grace Shall Inspire Both My Heart And My Tongue.

4
O, Who'S Like My Savior? He'S Salem'S Bright King;
He Smiles, And He Loves Me, And Helps Me To Sing.
I'Ll Praise Him, I'Ll Praise Him, With Notes Loud And Clear
While Rivers Of Pleasure My Spirit Do Cheer.
