094 - Nature With Open Volume Stands


1
Nature With Open Volume Stands,
To Spread Its Maker'S Praise Abroad;
And Every Labor Of His Hands
Shows Something Worthy Of Our God.

2
But In The Grace That Rescued Us
His Brightest Form Of Glory Shines;
'Tis Fairest Drawn Upon The Cross
In Precious Blood And Crimson Lines.

3
Here His Whole Name Appears Complete.
Nor Wit Can Guess, Nor Reason Prove,
Which Of The Letters Best Is Writ,
The Pow'R, The Wisdom, Or The Love.

4
We Would Forever Speak His Name
In Sounds To Mortal Ears Unknown,
With Angels Join To Praise The Lamb,
And Worship At His Father'S Throne.
