171 - Thine Is The Glory


1
Thine Is The Glory,
Risen, Conquering Son;
Endless Is The Victory Thou O'Er Death Hast Won.
Angels In Bright Raiment Rolled The Stone Away,
Kept The Folded Grave-Clothes Where Thy Body Lay.

Refrain
Thine Is The Glory,
Risen, Conquering Son;
Endless Is The Victory Thou O'Er Death Hast Won.

2
Lo! Jesus Meets Us.
Risen From The Tomb,
Lovingly He Greets Us,
Scatters Fear And Gloom;
Let His Church With Gladness Hymns Of Triumph Sing,
For Her Lord Now Liveth;
Death Has Lost Its Sting.

3
No More We Doubt Thee,
Glorious Prince Of Life!
Life Is Nought Without Thee;
Aid Us In Our Strife;
Make Us More Than Conquerors Through Thy Deathless Love
Bring Us Safe Through Jordan To Thy Home Above.
