254 - The Great Physician Now Is Near


1
The Great Physician Now Is Near,
The Sympathizing Jesus;
He Speaks The Drooping Heart To Cheer,
Oh! Hear The Voice Of Jesus.

Refrain
Sweetest Note In Seraph Song,
Sweetest Name On Mortal Tongue;
Sweetest Carol Ever Sung,
Jesus, Blessed Jesus.

2
Your Many Sins Are All Forgiven,
Oh! Hear The Voice Of Jesus;
Go On Your Way In Peace To Heaven,
And Wear A Crown With Jesus.

3
All Glory To The Dying Lamb!
I Now Believe In Jesus;
I Love The Blessed Savior'S Name,
I Love The Name Of Jesus.

4
His Name Dispels My Guilt And Fear,
No Other Name But Jesus;
Oh! How My Soul Delights To Hear
The Charming Name Of Jesus.
