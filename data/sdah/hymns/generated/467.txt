467 - Life Is Great! So Sing About It


1
Life Is Great! So Sing About It,
As We Can And As We Should-
Shop And Buses, Towns And People,
Village, Farmland, Field And Wood,
Life Is Great And Life Is Given;
Life Is Lovely, Free And Good.

2
Life Is Great! What Ever Happens,
Snow Or Sunshine, Joy Or Pain,
Hardship, Grief Or Disillusion,
Suffering That I Can'T Explain
Life Is Great If Someone Loves Me,
Holds My Hand And Calls My Name.

3
Love Is Great! The Love Of Lovers,
Whispered Words And Longing Eyes;
Love That Gazes At The Cradle
Where A Child Of Loving Lies;
Love That Lasts When Youth Has Faded,
Bends With Age, But Never Dies.

4
Love Is Giving And Receiving
Boy And Girl, Or Friend With Friend;
Love Is Bearing And Forgiving
All The Hurts That Hate Can Send;
Love'S The Greatest Way Of Living,
Hoping, Trusting To The End.

5
God Is Great! In Christ He Loved Us,
As We Should, But Never Can-
Love That Suffered, Hoped And Trusted
When Disciples Turned And Ran,
Love That Broke Through Death Forever.
Praise That Loving, Living Man!
