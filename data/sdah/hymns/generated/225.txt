225 - God Is Working His Purpose Out


1
God Is Working His Purpose Out
As Year Suceeds To Year;
God Is Working His Purpose Out,
And The Time Is Drawing Near;
Nearer And Nearer Draws The Time,
The Time That Shall Surely Be
When The Earth Shall Be Filled With The Glory Of God
As The Waters Cover The Sea.

2
From Utmost East To Utmost West,
Where'Er Man'S Foot Hath Trod,
By The Mouth Of Many Messengers
Goes Forth The Voice Of God;
Give Ear To Me, Ye Confinents,
Ye Isles, Give Ear To Me,
That The Earth Shall Be Filled With The Glory Of God
As The Waters Cover The Sea.

3
March We Forth In The Strength Of God
With The Banner Of Christ Unfurled,
That The Light Of The Glorious Gospel Of Truth
May Shine Throughout The World:
Fight We The Fight With Sorrow And Sin
To Set Their Captives Free,
That The Earth Shall Be Filled With The Glory Of God
As The Waters Cover The Sea.

4
All We Can Do Is Nothing Worth
Unless God Blesses The Deed;
Vainly We Hope For The Harvest Tide
Till God Gives Life To Teh Seed;
Yet Nearer And Nearer Draws The Time,
The Time That Shall Surely Be,
When The Earth Shall Be Filled With The Glory Of God
As The Waters Cover The Sea.
