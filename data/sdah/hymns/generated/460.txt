460 - As Water To The Thirsty


1
As Water To The Thirsty,
As Beauty To The Eyes,
As Strength That Follows Weakness,
As Truth Instead Of Lies;
As Song-Time And Springtime And Summertime To Be,
So Is My Lord, My Living Lord,
So Is My Lord To Me.

2
Like Calm In Place Of Clamor
Like Peace That Follows Pain,
Like Meeting After Parting,
Like Sunshine After Rain;
Like Moonlight And Starlight And Sunlight On The Sea,
So Is My Lord, My Living Lord,
So Is My Lord To Me.

3
As Sleep That Follows Fever,
As Gold Instead Of Grey,
As Freedom After Bondage,
As Sunrise To The Day;
As Home To The Trav'Ler And All He Longs To See,
So Is My Lord, My Living Lord,
So Is My Lord To Me.
