544 - Jesus, Son Of Blessed Mary


1
Jesus, Son Of Blessed Mary,
Once On Earth A Little Child,
Pattern Fair Of Holy Living,
Gracious, Loving, Undefiled;

2
Though Thy Eager Heart Was Yearning
Heavy Laden Souls To Free,
Yet Thou Calledst Little Children
In Their Happiness To Thee.

3
Grant That We, Like Little Children,
Free From Pride And Guile My Be;
Cheerful, Trusting, Safe, Protected
By The Blessed Trinity.
