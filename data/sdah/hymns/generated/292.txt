292 - Jesus, I Come


1
Out Of My Bondage, Sorrow And Night,
Jesus, I Come, Jesus, I Come;
Into Thy Freedom, Gladness And Light,
Jesus, I Come To Thee;
Out Of My Sickness Into Thy Health,
Out Of My Want And Into Thy Wealth,
Out Of My Sin And Into Thyself,
Jesus, I Come To Thee.

2
Out Of My Shameful Failure And Loss,
Jesus, I Come, Jesus, I Come;
Into The Glorious Gain Of Thy Cross,
Jesus, I Come To Thee;
Out Of Earth'S Sorrows Into Thy Balm,
Out Of Life'S Storms And Into Thy Calm,
Out Of Distress To Jubilant Psalm,
Jesus, I Come To Thee.

3
Out Of Unrest And Arrogant Pride,
Jesus, I Come, Jesus, I Come;
Into Thy Blessed Will To Abide,
Jesus, I Come To Thee;
Out Of Myself To Dwell In Thy Love,
Out Of Despair Into Raptures Above,
Upward For Aye On Wings Like A Dove,
Jesus, I Come To Thee.

4
Out Of The Fear And Dread Of The Tomb,
Jesus, I Come, Jesus, I Come;
Into The Joy And Light Of Thy Home,
Jesus, I Come To Thee;
Out Of The Depths Of Ruin Untold,
Into The Peace Of Thy Sheltering Fold,
Ever Thy Glorious Face To Behold,
Jesus, I Come To Thee.
