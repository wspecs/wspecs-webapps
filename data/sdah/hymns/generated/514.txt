514 - Lord Of Our Life


1
Lord Of Our Life, And God Of Our Salvation,
Star Of Our Night, And Hope Of Every Nation,
Hear And Receive Thy Church'S Supplication,
Lord God Almighty.

2
Lord, Thou Canst Help When Earthly Armor Faileth;
Lord, Thou Canst Save When Deadly Sin Assaileth;
Lord, O'Er Thy Rock Nor Death Nor Hell Prevaileth;
Grant Us Thy Peace, Lord

3
Peace In Our Hearts Our Evil Thoughts Assuaging;
Peace In Thy Church, Where Brothers Are Engaging;
Peace, When The World Its Busy War Is Waging;
Send Us, O Savior.

4
Grant Us Thy Help Till Foes Are Backward Driven;
Grant Them Thy Truth That They May Be Forgiven;
Grant Peace On Earth, And, After We Have Striven,
Peace In Thy Heaven.
