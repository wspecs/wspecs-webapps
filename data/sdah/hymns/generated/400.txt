400 - I Come With Joy


1
I Come With Joy To Meet My Lord,
Forgiven, Loved And Free,
In Awe And Wonder To Recall
His Life Laid Down For Me,
His Life Laid Down For Me.

2
I Come With Christians Far And Near
To Find, As All Are Fed,
Our True Community Of Love
In Christ'S Communion Bread,
In Christ'S Communion Bread.

3
As Christ Breaks Bread For Us To Share
Each Proud Division Ends.
That Love That Made Us Makes Us One,
And Strangers Now Are Friends,
And Strangers Now Are Friends.

4
And Thus With Joy We Meet Our Lord.
His Presence Always Near,
Is In Such Friendship Better Known:
We See And Praise Him Here,
We See And Praise Him Here.

5
Together Met, Together Bound,
We'Ll Go Our Diff'Rent Ways,
And As His People In The World,
We'Ll Live And Speak His Praise,
We'Ll Live And Speak His Praise.
