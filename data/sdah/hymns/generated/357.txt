357 - Come, Labor On


1
Come, Labor On.
Who Dares Stand Idle On The Harvest Plain
While All Around Him Waves The Golden Grain?
And To Each Servant Does The Master Say,
"Go Work Today."

2
Come, Labor On.
Claim The High Calling Angels Cannot Share;
To Young And Old The Gospel Gladness Bear;
Redeem The Time; Its Hours Too Swiftly Fly.
The Night Draws Nigh.

3
Come, Labor On.
No Time For Rest; Till Glows The Western Sky,
Till The Long Shadows OÃ©R Our Pathway Lie,
And A Glad Sound Comes With The Setting Sun,
"Well Done, Well Done!"
