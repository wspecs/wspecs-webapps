296 - Lord, I'M Coming Home


1
I'Ve Wandered Far Away From God,
Now I'M Coming Home;
The Paths Of Sin Too Long I'Ve Trod;
Lord, I'M Coming Home.

Refrain
Coming Home, Coming Home
Never More To Roam;
Open Wide Thine Arms Of Love;
Lord I'M Coming Home.

2
I'Ve Wasted Many Precious Years,
Now I'M Coming Home;
I Now Repent With Bitter Tears;
Lord, I'M Coming Home.

3
I'M Tired Of Sin And Straying Lord,
Now I'M Coming Home;
I'Ll Trust Thy Love Belive Thy Word;
Lord I'M Coming Home.

4
My Only Hope, My Only Plea,
Now I'M Coming Home;
That Jesus Died, And Died For Me;
Lord I'M Coming Home.

5
I Need His Cleansing Blood I Know,
Now I'M Coming Home;
O Wash Me Whiter Than The Snow;
Lord I'M Coming Home.
