391 - Welcome, Welcome, Day Of Rest


1
To The World In Kindness Given;
Welcome To This Humble Breast,
As The Beaming Light From Heaven.

2
Day Of Calm And Sweet Repose,
Gently Now Thy Moments Run;
Balm To Soothe Our Cares And Woes,
Till Our Labor Here Is Done.

3
Holy Day That Most We Prize,
Day Of Solemn Praise And Prayer,
Day To Make The Simple Wise,
O, How Great Thy Blessings Are!

4
Welcome, Welcome, Day Of Rest,
With Thy Influence All Divine;
May Thy Hallowed Hours Be Blessed
To This Waiting Heart Of Mine.
