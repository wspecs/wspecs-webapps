404 - Now Let Us From This Table Rise


1
Now Let Us From This Table Rise
Renewed In Body, Mind, And Soul;
With Christ We Die And Live Again,
His Selfless Love Has Made Us Whole.

2
With Minds Alert, Upheld By Grace,
To Spread The Word In Speech And Deed,
We Follow In The Steps Of Christ,
At One With All In Hope And Need.

3
To Fill Each Human House With Love,
It Is The Sacrament Of Care;
The Work That Christ Began To Do
We Humbly Pledge Ourselves To Share.

4
Then Grant Us Courage, Father God,
To Choose Again The Pilgrim Way
And Help Us To Accept With Joy
The Challenge Of Tomorrow'S Day.
