491 - In The Hour Of Trial


1
In The Hour Of Trial, Jesus, Plead For Me,
Lest By Base Denial I Depart From Thee;
When Thou See'St Me Waver, With A Look Recall,
Nor, For Fear Or Favor, Suffer Me To Fall.

2
With Forbidden Pleasures Would This Vain World Charm;
Or Its Sordid Treasures Spread To Work Me Harm;
Bring To My Remembrance Sad Gethsemane,
Or, In Darker Semblance, Cross-Crowned Calvary.

3
Should Thy Mercy Send Me Sorrow, Toil, And Woe,
Or Should Pain Attend Me On My Path Below,
Grant That I May Never Fail Thy Hand To See;
Grant That I May Ever Cast My Care On Thee.
