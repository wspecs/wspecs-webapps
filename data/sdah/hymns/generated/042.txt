042 - Now That The Daylight Fills The Sky


1
Now That The Daylight Fills The Sky,
We Lift Our Hearts To God On High,
That He, In All We Do Or Say,
Would Keep Us Free From Harm Today;

2
Would Guard Our Hearts And Tongues From Strife;
From Anger'S Din Would Shield Our Life;
From Evil Sights Would Turn Our Eyes,
And Close Our Ears To Vanities;

3
So We, When This New Day Is Gone
And Night In Turn Is Drawing On,
With Conscience By The World Unstained
Shall Praise His Name For Vict'Ry Gained.

4
"All Praise To You, Creator Lord!
All Praise To You, Eternal Word!
All Praise To You, O Spirit Wise!"
We Sing As Daylight Fills The Skies.
