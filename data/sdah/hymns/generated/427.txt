427 - No Night There


1
In The Land Of Fadeless Day
Lies "The City Four-Square;"
It Shall Never Pass Away,
And There Is "No Night There."

Refrain
God Shall "Wipe Away All Tears;"
There'S No Death, No Pain, Nor Fears;
And They Count Not Time By Years,
For There Is "No Night There."

2
All The Gates Of Pearl Are Made,
In "The City Four-Square;"
All The Streets With Gold Are Laid,
And There Is "No Night There."

3
And The Gates Shall Never Close
To "The City Four-Square;"
There Life'S Crystal River Flows,
And There Is "No Night There."

4
There They Need No Sunshine Bright,
In "That City Four-Square;"
For The Lamb Is All The Light,
And There Is "No Night There."
