074 - Like A River Glorious


1
Like A River Glorious, Is God'S Perfect Peace,
Over All Victorious, In Its Bright Increase;
Perfect, Yet It Floweth, Fuller Every Day,
Perfect, Yet It Groweth, Deeper All The Way.

Refrain
Stayed Upon Jehovah, Hearts Are Fully Blessed
Finding, As He Promised, Perfect Peace And Rest.

2
Hidden In The Hollow Of His Blessed Hand,
Never Foe Can Follow, Never Traitor Stand;
Not A Surge Of Worry, Not A Shade Of Care,
Not A Blast Of Hurry Touch The Spirit There.

3
Every Joy Or Trial Falleth From Above,
Traced Upon Our Dial By The Sun Of Love;
We May Trust Him Fully All For Us To Do.
They Who Trust Him Wholly Find Him Wholly True.
