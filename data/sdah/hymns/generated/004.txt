004 - Praise, My Soul, The King Of Heaven


1
Praise, My Soul, The King Of Heaven;
To His Feet Thy Tribute Bring;
Ransomed, Healed, Restored, Forgiven,
Who Like Thee His Praise Should Sing?
Praise Him, Praise Him, Alleluia!
Praise The Everlasting King.

2
Praise Him For His Grace And Favor
To Our Fathers In Distress;
Praise Him Still The Same Forever,
Slow To Chide And Swift To Bless:
Praise Him, Praise Him, Alleluia!
Glorious In His Faithfulness.

3
Tenderly He Shields And Spares Us;
Well Our Feeble Frame He Knows;
In His Hands He Gently Bears Us,
Rescues Us From All Our Foes.
Praise Him, Praise Him, Alleluia!
Widely Yet His Mercy Flows.

4
Angels, Help Us To Adore Him;
Ye Behold Him Face To Face;
Sun And Moon, Bow Down Before Him,
Dwellers All In Time And Space.
Praise Him, Praise Him, Alleluia!
Praise With Us The God Of Grace.
