481 - Dear Lord And Father


1
Dear Lord And Father Of Mankind,
Forgive Our Foolish Ways;
Reclothe Us In Our Rightful Mind,
In Purer Lives Thy Service Find,
In Deeper Reverence, Praise.

2
In Simple Trust Like Theirs Who Heard,
Beside The Syrian Sea,
The Gracious Calling Of The Lord,
Let Us, Like Them, Without A Word,
Rise Up And Follow Thee.

3
O Sabbath Rest By Galilee,
O Calm Of Hills Above,
Where Jesus Knelt To Share With Thee
The Silence Of Eternity,
Interpreted By Love!

4
Drop Thy Still Dews Of Quietness,
Till All Our Strivings Cease;
Take From Our Souls The Strain And Stress,
And Let Our Ordered Lives Confess
The Beauty Of Thy Peace.

5
Breathe Through The Heats Of Our Desire
Thy Coolness And Thy Balm;
Let Sense Be Dumb, Let Flesh Retire;
Speak Through The Earthquake, Wind, And Fire,
O Still, Small Voice Of Calm.
