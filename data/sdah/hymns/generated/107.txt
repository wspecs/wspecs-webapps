107 - God Moves In A Mysterious Way


1
God Moves In A Mysterious Way
His Wonders To Perform;
He Plants His Footsteps In The Sea,
And Rides Upon The Storm.

2
Ye Fearful Saints, Fresh Courage Take;
The Clouds Ye So Much Dread
Are Big With Mercy, And Shall Break
In Blessings On Your Head.

3
Judge Not The Lord By Feeble Sense,
But Trust Him For His Grace;
Behind A Frowning Providence
He Hides A Smiling Face.

4
His Purposes Will Ripen Fast,
Unfolding Every Hour;
The Bud May Have A Bitter Taste,
But Sweet Will Be The Flower.

5
Blind Unbelief Is Sure To Err,
And Scan His Work In Vain;
God Is His Own Interpreter,
And He Will Make It Plain.
