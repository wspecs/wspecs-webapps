332 - The Cleansing Wave


1
Oh Now I See The Crimson Wave,
The Fountain Deep And Wide;
Jesus, My Lord, Mighty To Save,
Points To His Wounded Side.

Refrain
The Cleansing Stream I See, I See,
I Plunge, And O, It Cleanseth Me!
O Praise The Lord! It Cleanseth Me,
It Cleanseth Me, Yes, Cleanseth Me.

2
I See The New Creation Rise,
I Hear The Speaking Blood;
It Speaks Polluted Nature Dies,
Sinks 'Neath The Cleansing Flood.

3
I Rise To Walk In Heaven'S Own Light,
Above The World And Sin;
With Heart Made Pure And Garments White,
And Christ Enthroned Within.

4
Amazing Grace! 'Tis Heaven Below
To Feel The Blood Applied,
And Jesus, Only Jesus, Know,
My Jesus Crucified.
