311 - I Would Be Like Jesus


1
Earthly Pleasures Vainly Call Me;
I Would Be Like Jesus;
Nothing Worldly Shall Enthrall Me;
I Would Be Like Jesus.

Refrain
Be Like Jesus, This My Song,
In The Home And In The Throng;
Be Like Jesus, All Day Long!
I Would Be Like Jesus.

2
He Has Broken Every Fetter,
I Would Be Like Jesus;
That My Soul May Serve Him Better,
I Would Be Like Jesus.

3
All The Way From Earth To Glory,
I Would Be Like Jesus;
Telling O'Er And O'Er The Story,
I Would Be Like Jesus.

4
That In Heaven He May Meet Me,
I Would Be Like Jesus;
That His Words "Well Done" May Greet Me,
I Would Be Like Jesus.
