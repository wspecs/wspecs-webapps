030 - Holy God, We Praise Your Name


1
Holy God, We Praise Your Name;
Lord Of All, We Bow Before You!
All On Earth Your Scepter Claim,
All In Heaven Above Adore You;
Infinite Your Vast Domain.
Everlasting Is Your Reign.

2
Hark! The Loud Celestial Hymn
Angel Choirs Above Are Raising,
Cherubim And Seraphim,
In Unceasing Chorus Praising;
Fill The Heavens With Sweet Accord:
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord.

3
Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three We Name You;
While In Essence Only One,
Undivided God We Claim You;
And Adoring Bend The Knee,
While We Own The Mystery.
