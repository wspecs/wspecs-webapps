114 - There'S A Wideness


1
There'S A Wideness, In God'S Mercy,
Like The Wideness Of The Sea;
There Is Mercy, With The Savior,
Which Is More Than Liberty.

2
There Is Welcome, For The Sinner,
And More Graces For The Good;
There Is Mercy, With The Savior,
There Is Healing In His Blood.

3
For The Love Of God Is Broader
Than The Measure Of Man'S Mind.
And The Heart Of The Eternal,
Is Most Wonderfully Kind.

4
If Our Love Were But More Simple,
We Should Take Him At His Word;
And Our Lives Would Be All Sunshine,
In The Sweetness Of Our Lord.
