412 - Cover With His Life


1
Look Upon Jesus, Sinless Is He;
Father, Impute His Life Unto Me.
My Life Of Scarlet, My Sin And Woe,
Cover With His Life, Whiter Than Snow.

Refrain
Cover With His Life, Whiter Than Snow;
Fullness Of His Life Then Shall I Know;
My Life Of Scarlet, My Sin And Woe,
Cover With His Life, Whither Than Snow.

2
Deep Are The Wounds Transgression Has Made;
Red Are The Stains; My Soul Is Afraid.
O To Be Covered, Jesus, With Thee,
Safe From The Law That Now Judgeth Me!

3
Longing The Joy Of Pardon To Know;
Jesus Holds Out A Robe White As Snow;
"Lord, I Accept It! Leaving My Own,
Gladly I Wear Thy Pure Life Alone."

4
Reconciled By His Death For My Sin,
Justified By His Life Pure And Clean,
Sanctified By Obeying His Word,
Glorified When Returneth My Lord.
