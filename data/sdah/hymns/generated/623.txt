623 - I Will Follow Thee


1
I Will Follow Thee, My Savior,
Wheresoe'Er My Lot May Be.
Where Thou Goest I Will Follow;
Yes, My Lord, I'Ll Follow Thee.

Refrain
I Will Follow Thee, My Saviour,
Thou Didst Shed Thy Blood For Me;
And Though All Men Should Forsake Thee;
By Thy Grace I'Ll Follow Thee.

2
Though The Road Be Rough And Thorny,
Trackless As The Foaming Sea,
Thou Hast Trod This Way Before Me,
And I'Ll Gladly Follow Thee.

3
Though I Meet With Tribulations,
Sorely Tempted Though I Be;
I Remember Thou Wast Tempted,
And Rejoice To Follow Thee.

4
Though Thou Leadest Me Through Affliction,
Poor, Forsaken Though I Be;
Thou Wast Destitute, Afflicted,
And I Only Follow Thee.

5
Though To Jordan'S Rolling Billows,
Cold And Deep, Thou Leadest Me,
Thou Hast Crossed The Waves Before Me,
And I Still Will Follow Thee.
