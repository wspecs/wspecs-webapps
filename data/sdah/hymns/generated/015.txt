My Maker And My King,
To Thee My All I Owe;
Thy Sovereign Bounty Is The Spring
Whence All My Blessings Flow;
Thy Sovereign Bounty Is The Spring
Whence All My Blessings Flow.

The Creature Of Thy Hand,
On Thee Alone I Live;
My God, Thy Benefits Demand
More Praise Than I Can Give.
My God, Thy Benefits Demand
More Praise Than I Can Give.

Lord, What Can I Impart
When All Is Thine Before?
Thy Love Demands A Thankful Heart;
The Gift, Alas! How Poor.
Thy Love Demands A Thankful Heart;
The Gift, Alas! How Poor.

O! Let Thy Grace Inspire
My Soul With Strength Divine;
Let Every Word Each Desire
And All My Days Be Thine.
Let Every Word Each Desire
And All My Days Be Thine.
