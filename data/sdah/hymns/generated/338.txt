338 - Redeemed!


1
Redeemed, How I Love To Proclaim It!
Redeemed By The Blood Of The Lamb;
Redeemed Thro' His Infinite Mercy,
His Child, And Forever, I Am.

Refrain
Redeemed, Redeemed,
Redeemed By The Blood Of The Lamb;
Redeemed, How I Love To Proclaim It!
His Child And Forever I Am.

2
I Think Of My Blessed Redeemer,
I Think Of Him All The Day Long;
I Sing, For I Cannot Be Silent;
His Love Is The Theme Of My Song.

3
I Know I Shall See In His Beauty
The King In Whose Law I Delight,
Who Lovingly Guardeth My Footsteps,
And Giveth Me Songs In The Night.
