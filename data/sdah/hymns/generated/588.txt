588 - Lord Of All Nations


1
Lord Of All Nations, Grant Me Grace
To Love All People, Every Race,
And In Each Person May I See
My Kindred Loved, Redeemed By Thee.

2
Break Down The Wall That Would Divide
Thy Children, Lord, On Every Side.
My Neighbor'S Good Let Me Pursue;
Let Christian Love Bind Warm And True.

3
Forgive Me, Lord, Where I Have Erred
By Loveless Act And Thoughtless Word.
Make Me To See The Wrong I Do
Will Crucify My Lord Anew.

4
Give Me Thy Courage, Lord, To Speak
Whenever Strong Oppress The Weak.
Should I Myself The Victim Be,
Help Me Forgive, Remembering Thee.

5
With Thine Own Love May I Be Filled
And By Thy Holy Spirit Willed,
That All I Touch, Where'Er I Be,
May Be Divinely Touched By Thee.
