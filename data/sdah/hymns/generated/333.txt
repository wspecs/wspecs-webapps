333 - On Jordan'S Banks The Baptist'S Cry


1
On Jordan'S Banks The Baptist'S Cry
Announces That The Lord Is Nigh;
Awake And Hearken, For He Brings
Glad Tidings Of The King Of Kings!

2
Then Cleansed Be Every Life From Sin;
Make Straight The Way For God Within,
And Let Us All Our Hearts Prepare
For Christ To Come And Enter There.

3
We Hail You As Our Savior, Lord,
Our Refuge And Our Great Reward;
Without Your Grace We Waste Away
Like Flow'Rs That Wither And Decay.

4
Stretch Forth Your Hand, Our Health Restore,
And Make Us Rise To Fall No More;
Oh, Let Your Face Upon Us Shine
And Fill The World With Love Divine.
