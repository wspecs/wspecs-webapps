Through his associations with these nations, their heathen practices became less abhorrent to him, and at last their sensual customs and their darkest worships were imported into Palestine. Solomon’s fine sensibilities were blunted, his conscience seared. He became weak and vacillating. The justice of his early reign gave place to tyranny.

I have known her nearly 40 years, and Mrs. Starr has known her over 50 years. We have learned from her own lips the story of her early conversion at the age of 13 years, from doubt and darkness into light and special love for the person of Jesus Christ. I think I have never heard any other person speak of love for Jesus, personal love, as I have heard her speak. Many times, in large congregations, I have heard her break forth in the expression, “Jesus, I love you; I love you, I love you!” Some here know that; they have heard it; and it has thrilled the audience. We have felt the influence of that love for Jesus.","ref":"216.1","k":826,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"I believe it is a splendid thing for us to emulate, not only to have faith in a general way, but faith in Jesus and in His love.

The language in her writings is of the most attractive, simple, and forceful style. Now, I will leave you to judge that for yourselves, that it is attractive, elevating, forceful, and there is nothing to be found like it in the world. I have never seen anyone whose writings at all imitated her writings. In the little book Steps to Christ—I had the privilege of reading that book in the manuscript, and she asked several of us to advise what should be done with it. “Why,” we said, “put it into every language as soon as possible, for it is the simplest, clearest guide in the saving faith of Jesus we have ever read.” That book has been translated into [many] languages.","ref":"216.3","k":828,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"I saw a table with a complete set of her published books on it.

Her remembrance of names of individuals was very remarkable. She never seemed to forget a person whom she met in any part of the world. She carried them on her heart and in her prayers. Her faithfulness in friendship was very marked, extending through trial and temptation. As the little boy at school said when asked the meaning of friendship, “A true friend is one who knows all about you and loves you just the same,” so we can say of her, that though she knew the failings of her friends very well, she loved them just the same, and prayed for them and labored for them just the same.","ref":"218.2","k":833,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"Another word about her character: I regarded her as one of the sturdiest characters I ever met.

She met trial and opposition from those who ought to have been friendly; and she met it in the kindest, sweetest spirit, but with the firmest determination to conquer, always conquer. I never knew her to be conquered. Her faith in God was invincible in this country, or any other country. Under circumstances that would have swamped the faith of many, she triumphed under trial.","ref":"218.3","k":834,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"Just a word further about her sickness.

I expect trials, losses, disappointments, and bereavements”—and she had them, two children and her husband buried where she will soon be buried by their side, in Michigan; she had her trials in that way, and in other ways—“but I have the Saviour’s promise, ‘My grace is sufficient for thee.’","ref":"219.2","k":836,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"“My sickness has taught me my own weakness, and my Saviour’s patience and love, and His power to save. When passing sleepless nights, I have found hope and comfort in considering the forbearance and tenderness of Jesus toward His weak, erring disciples, and remembering that He is still the same—unchangeable in mercy, compassion, and love. He sees our weakness; He knows how we lack faith and courage; yet He does not cast us off. He is pitiful and of tender compassion toward us.”","ref":"219.3","k":837,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"About six weeks ago we called on her, and she said, “When were you in last to see me?”","ref":"219.4","k":838,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"“Just last Sabbath afternoon,” I replied.","ref":"220.1","k":839,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"“Oh, yes,” she said, “I forgot.” And then she turned to us and said: “We all have our weaknesses and our forgetfulnesses, but if we correct them they add strength to our characters and do not belittle us.” Now that, you see, is similar to her statement that Christ reveals his tender compassion through suffering.","ref":"220.2","k":840,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"Speaking of her death, she said: “I may fall at my post before the Lord shall come; but when all that are in their graves shall come forth, I shall, if faithful to”—and she was faithful—“see Jesus, and be made like Him.

I want to read you one verse of one song that she very much delighted in. We heard her singing it the other morning, as we were at the bottom of the stairs. We said, “Who is that singing?” And they said, “That is Sister White.” Here is what she sang: “We have heard from the bright, the holy land, we have heard, and our hearts are glad; for we were a lonely pilgrim band, and weary, and worn, and sad.

I said, “We are glad to find you so bright this morning.” This was her reply: “I am glad you find me thus, and I wish to tell you that it is bright inside.” And then she added, “I have not had many mournful days, have I?” “No, Sister White,” I said, “not in all your life, because you have risen above them.” “Yes,” said she, “my heavenly father has planned it all for me, and he knows when it will end, and I am determined not to murmur.”","ref":"221.2","k":845,"code":"RY"},{"chapter":18,"text":"I felt that that was a great triumph—and she did triumph.
