This act shows our dependence upon God.” It is also a sign of reverence: “There should be an intelligent knowledge of how to come to God in reverence and Godly fear with devotional love. There is a growing lack of reverence for our maker, a growing disregard of His greatness and His majesty.”—Manuscript 84b, 1897 (Quoted in Selected Messages 2:312.)That Ellen White did not intend to teach that on every prayer occasion we must kneel is made clear both by her words and her example. To her there was no time or place where prayer was not appropriate. Her family testified that in her home those at the dining table bowed their heads and not their knees. She was not known to kneel for the benediction at the close of services she attended. The earnest counsel on kneeling would seem to have its principal application in the worship services in the house of God and in family and private devotions at home. In public ministry there were times when she stood for prayer.—Compilers.]—May the Lord help you to take hold of this work as you have never yet taken hold of it. Will you do this?
