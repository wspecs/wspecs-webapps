But it is not God’s will that His people shall settle in the cities, where there is constant turmoil and confusion. Their children should be spared this; for the whole system is demoralized by the hurry and rush and noise. The Lord desires His people to move into the country, where they can settle on the land, and raise their own fruit and vegetables, and where their children can be brought in direct contact with the works of God in nature. Take your families away from the cities is my message.","ref":"29.5","k":187,"code":"CL"},{"chapter":"8","text":"The truth must be spoken, whether men will hear, or whether men will forbear.
