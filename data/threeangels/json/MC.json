The importance of the work of the ministry is unmistakable; this is one of God’s means for enlightening the world. But He has other means also. He uses the power of the press in printing papers and books containing the messages of truth. These are essential in the carrying forward of the gospel. Many who are hungry for the bread of life have not the privilege of hearing the word from God’s delegated preachers. For this reason it is essential that our publications be widely circulated. The sheets that come from the groaning press to be prepared as tracts and bound up as books are to go forth to all parts of the earth. Thus the message will go where the living preacher can not go, and the attention of many will be called to the important events connected with the closing scenes of this world’s history.","ref":"5.1","k":4,"code":"MC"},{"chapter":"1","text":"God has ordained the canvassing work as a means of presenting before the people the light contained in our books; and canvassers should be impressed with the importance of bringing before the world as fast as possible the books necessary for their spiritual education and enlightenment. This is the very work the Lord desires His people to do at this time. All who consecrate themselves to God to work as canvassers are assisting to give the last message of warning to the world. We can not too highly estimate this work; for were it not for the efforts of the canvasser, many would never hear the warning.","ref":"5.2","k":5,"code":"MC"},{"chapter":"1","text":"It is true that some who buy the books will lay them on the shelf or place them on the parlor table, and seldom look at them. Still God has a care for His truth, and the time will come when these books will be sought for and read. Sickness or misfortune may enter the home, and through the truth contained in these books God sends to troubled hearts peace and hope and rest. His love is revealed to them, and they understand the preciousness of the forgiveness of their sins. Thus the Lord cooperates with His self-denying workers.","ref":"6.1","k":6,"code":"MC"},{"chapter":"1","text":"There are many, who, because of prejudice, will never know the truth unless it is brought to their homes.

God has spoken plainly and clearly: “The Spirit and the bride say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come.” Revelation 22:17.

Papers and books are the Lord’s means of keeping the message for this time continually before the people. In enlightening and confirming souls in the truth, the publications will do a far greater work than can be accomplished by the ministry of the word alone. The silent messengers that are placed in the homes of the people through the efforts of the canvasser, will strengthen the gospel ministry in every way; for the Holy Spirit will impress minds as they read the books, just as He impresses the minds of those who listen to the preaching of the word.

By beholding, you will become changed from glory to glory, from character to character. God wants you to come to the front, speaking the words He will give you.

There have been those who were unable to go to school, because they were too poor to pay their way. But when they became sons and daughters of God, they took hold of the work where they were, laboring for those around them. Though destitute of the knowledge obtained in school, they consecrated themselves to God, and God worked through them. Like the disciples when called from their nets to follow Christ, they learned precious lessons from the Saviour. They linked themselves with the Great Teacher, and the knowledge they gained from the Scriptures qualified them to speak to others of Christ. Thus they became truly wise, because they were not too wise in their own estimation to receive instruction from above. The renewing power of the Holy Spirit gave them practical saving energy.","ref":"11.1","k":21,"code":"MC"},{"chapter":"2","text":"The knowledge of the most learned man, if he has not learned in Christ’s school, is foolishness so far as leading souls to Christ is concerned.

It is only when our hearts are imbued with the spirit of the truths contained in the book we are selling, and when in humility we call the attention of the people to these truths, that real success will attend our efforts; for it is only then that the Holy Spirit, who convinces of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, will be present to impress hearts.","ref":"12.1","k":23,"code":"MC"},{"chapter":"2","text":"Our books should be handled by consecrated workers, whom the Holy Spirit can use as His instrumentalities.

His strength, his courage, his success, will depend on how fully the truth presented in the books is woven into his own experience and developed in his character.

The faithful, youthful Timothy was taught by experienced men of God’s appointment how to study the word and how to explain it. Paul, his father in the gospel, speaking by the Holy Spirit, addressed him in the words: “Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.” “Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” “Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.” “And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.” 2 Timothy 2:1, 15; 1:13; 2:2, 3.

God desires us to be faithful in educating those who accept the truth, that they may believe to a purpose, and work intelligently in the Lord’s way. Let inexperienced persons be connected with experienced workers, that they may learn how to work. Let them seek God most earnestly. These may do a good work in canvassing if they will obey the words, “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine.” 1 Timothy 4:16.

It was the providence of God which in the beginning of the Christian church scattered the saints abroad, sending them out of Jerusalem into many parts of the world. The disciples of Christ did not stay in Jerusalem or in the cities near by, but they went beyond the limits of their own country into the great thoroughfares of travel, seeking for the lost that they might bring them to God.

We must not confine our labors to a few localities.","ref":"67.2","k":210,"code":"MC"},{"chapter":"6","text":"We must not discourage our brethren, weakening their hands so that the work which God desires to accomplish through them shall not be done.

Let young and old consecrate themselves to God, take up the work, and go forward, laboring in humility, under the control of the Holy Spirit. Let those who have been in school go out into the field, and put to a practical use the knowledge they have gained. If canvassers will do this, using the ability that God has given them, seeking counsel from Him, and combining the work of selling books with personal labor for the people, their talents will increase by exercise, and they will learn many practical lessons which they could not possibly learn in school. The education obtained in this practical way may properly be termed higher education.","ref":"68.1","k":211,"code":"MC"},{"chapter":"6","text":"There is no higher work than evangelistic canvassing; for it involves the performance of the highest moral duties.

We must love as brethren, revealing our love by helping one another. We must be pitiful and courteous. We must press together, drawing in even cords. Only those who live the prayer of Christ, working it out in practical life, will stand the test that is to come upon all the world. Those who exalt self, place themselves in Satan’s power, preparing to receive his deceptions. The word of the Lord to His people is that we are to lift the standard higher and still higher. If we obey His voice, He will work with us, and our efforts will be crowned with success.

There are ministers and workers who will present a tissue of falsehoods as testing truths, even as the Jewish rabbis presented the maxims of men as the word of God. These are given to the people as meat in due season, while their souls are starving for the bread of life. Even now there seems to be a burning desire to get up something startling and bring it in as new light. Men are presenting as important truth that which is only fable and falsehood. This imaginary food which is being prepared for the household of God will cause spiritual consumption, decline, and death. We are in the shaking time, the time when everything that can be shaken will be shaken. The Lord will not excuse those who know the truth if they do not in word and deed obey His commands. If we make no effort to win souls to Christ, we shall be held responsible for the work we might have done but did not do because of our spiritual indolence.

As responsible beings we are working for time and for eternity, making our records in the books of heaven, and preparing our reward or punishment.

This order of things should be changed. God calls the canvassers back to their work. He calls for volunteers who will put all their energies and enlightenment into the work, helping wherever there is opportunity. The Master calls for every one to do the part given him, according to his ability. Who will respond to the call? Who will go forth to labor in the wisdom and grace and love of Christ for those nigh and afar off? Who will sacrifice ease and pleasure and enter the places of error, superstition, and darkness, working earnestly and perseveringly, speaking the truth in simplicity, praying in faith, and doing house-to-house labor?

They are sounding the note of warning in the highways and byways to prepare a people for the great day of the Lord which is so soon to break upon the world. We have no time to lose. We must encourage this work. Who will go forth now with our publications? The Lord imparts a fitness for the work to every man and woman who will cooperate with divine power.
