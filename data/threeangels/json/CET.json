Here, at the age of nine years, an accident happened to me which was to affect my whole life. In company with my twin sister and one of our schoolmates, I was crossing a common in the city of Portland, when a girl about thirteen years of age, becoming angry at some trifle, threw a stone that hit me on the nose.

He counseled such ones to surrender themselves to God, and venture upon His mercy without delay. They would find a gracious Saviour ready to present to them the scepter of mercy, even as Ahasuerus offered to Esther the signal of his favor.

Many have a vague idea that they must make some wonderful effort in order to gain the favor of God. But all self-dependence is vain.

There was a surety in my heart that He understood my peculiar trials, and sympathized with me.

Now the sun shone bright and clear, and flooded the earth with light and warmth. The trees and grass were a fresher green, the sky a deeper blue. The earth seemed to smile under the peace of God.

They have brought comfort and consolation to many hearts. They have strengthened the weak, encouraged the feeble, raised up the despondent. They have brought order out of confusion, made crooked places straight, and thrown light on what was dark and obscure. And no person with an unprejudiced mind can read their stirring appeals for a pure and lofty morality, their exaltation of God and the Saviour, their denunciations of every evil, and their exhortations to everything that is holy and of good report, without being compelled to say, ‘these are not the words of him that hath a devil.’”","ref":"255.1","k":797,"code":"CET"},{"chapter":42,"text":"Value of Her Work","k":798,"code":"CET"},{"chapter":42,"text":"After full seventy years of active labor in many lands, in writing and preaching, Mrs. White quietly fell asleep in Jesus at her home near St. Helena, California, July 16, 1915.

The many volumes she has left, dealing with every phase of human life, urging every reform necessary to the betterment of society, as represented by the family, city, state, and nation, will continue to mold public sentiment and individual character. Their messages will be cherished more than they have been in the past.
