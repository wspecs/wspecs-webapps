But those who have been thus deceived by him find that all these things leave the soul unsatisfied.","k":2,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":1,"text":"God designs, however, that this longing shall lead to the One who alone is able to satisfy it. The desire is of Him that it may lead to Him, the fullness and fulfillment of that desire. That fullness is found in Jesus Christ, the Son of the Eternal God.

It is not, however, the purpose of this work to provide a harmony of the Gospels or to set forth in strictly chronological order the important events and wonderful lessons of the life of Christ. Its purpose is to present the love of God as revealed in His Son, the divine beauty of the life of Christ.","k":4,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":1,"text":"In the following pages the author opens before the reader undreamed-of riches from the life of Jesus. New and glorious light flashes forth from many familiar passages of Scripture. Jesus Christ is revealed as the Fullness of the Godhead, the infinitely merciful Saviour of sinners, the Sun of Righteousness, the merciful High Priest, mankind’s compelling Example, the Healer of all human maladies and diseases, the tender, compassionate Friend, the Prince of Peace, the Coming King, the culmination and fruition of the desires and hopes of all the ages.","k":5,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":1,"text":"We send forth this book with the prayer that the Holy Spirit will make its words, words of life to millions whose longings and desires are yet unsatisfied.","ref":"6.1","k":6,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":1,"text":"The Publishers.","k":7,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"Chapter 1—Christ Before Coming to Earth","k":8,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with the Father; He was the image of God, the outshining of His glory.

God with us.” Matthew 1:23; cf. Isaiah 7:14.","ref":"11.1","k":9,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"Jesus was “the Word of God”—God’s thought made audible. Not alone for His earthborn children was this revelation given. Our little world is the lesson book of the universe. Both redeemed and unfallen beings will find in the cross of Christ their science and their song. They will see that the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love. They will see that the law of life for earth and heaven is the law of self-renouncing love. That love which “seeketh not her own” has its source in the heart of God and is manifested in Jesus, the meek and lowly One.","ref":"11.2","k":10,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"In the beginning, Christ laid the foundations of the earth.

Nothing, save the selfish heart of man, lives unto itself. Every tree and shrub and leaf pours forth that element of life without which neither man nor animal could live; and man and animal, in turn, minister to the life of tree and shrub and leaf. The ocean receives streams from every land, but takes to give. The mists ascending from it fall in showers to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud. The angels of glory find their joy in giving. They bring light from above, and move upon the human spirit to bring the lost into fellowship with Christ.","ref":"11.4","k":12,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"But turning from all lesser representations, we behold God in Jesus. We see that it is the glory of God to give. “I seek not Mine own glory,” said Christ, but the glory of Him that sent Me. John 8:50; 7:18. Christ received from God, but He took to give. Through the Son, the Father’s life flows out to all; through the Son it returns in joyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source of all.

Lucifer, the covering cherub, desired to be first in heaven. He sought to draw heavenly beings away from their Creator and win homage to himself. Investing the Creator with his own evil characteristics, he led angels to doubt the word of God and distrust His goodness. Satan caused them to look upon Him as severe and unforgiving. Thus he deceived angels. Thus he deceived men, and the night of woe settled down upon the world.","ref":"12.2","k":15,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"The earth was dark through misapprehension of God. That the world might be brought back to God, Satan’s deceptive power was to be broken. This could not be done by force. God desires only the service of love, and love cannot be won by force or authority. Only by love is love awakened. To know God is to love Him; His character must be manifested in contrast to that of Satan. This work only one Being could do. Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could make it known.","ref":"12.3","k":16,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"The plan for our redemption was not a plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of “the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal.” Romans 16:25, RV. It was an unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God’s throne. God foresaw sin’s existence and made provision to meet the terrible emergency.

That we might behold it and not be destroyed, His glory was shrouded, His divinity veiled with humanity.","ref":"13.3","k":21,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"This great purpose had been shadowed forth in types and symbols. The burning bush, in which Christ appeared to Moses, revealed God. The lowly shrub, that seemingly had no attractions, enshrined the Infinite. God shrouded His glory that Moses could look upon it and live. So in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, God’s glory was veiled, that finite men might behold it. So Christ was to come “in the likeness of men.” He was the incarnate God, but His glory was veiled that He might draw near to sorrowful, tempted men.","ref":"13.4","k":22,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"Through Israel’s weary wandering in the desert, the symbol of God’s presence, the sanctuary, was with them.

He declares it impossible for us to obey its precepts. The fall of our first parents he charges upon the Creator, leading men to look upon God as the author of sin, suffering, and death. Jesus was to unveil this deception. As one of us He was to give an example of obedience. For this He took upon Himself our nature, and passed through our experiences. “In all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren.” Hebrews 2:17. If we had to bear anything which Jesus did not endure, then on this point Satan would represent the power of God as insufficient for us. Therefore Jesus was “in all points tempted like as we are.” Hebrews 4:15. He endured every trial to which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf no power not freely offered us. As man, He met temptation and overcame in the strength given Him from God. He made plain the character of God’s law, and His life testifies that it is possible for us also to obey the law of God.","ref":"14.2","k":25,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"By His humanity, Christ touched humanity; by His divinity, He lays hold on the throne of God. As Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as Son of God, He gives us power to obey. To us He says, “All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.” Matthew 28:18. “God with us” is the surety of our deliverance from sin, the assurance of power to obey the law of heaven. Christ revealed a character the opposite of that of Satan. “Being found in human form He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.” Philippians 2:8, RSV. Christ took the form of a servant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. “He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him.” Isaiah 53:5.","ref":"14.3","k":26,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"Treated As We Deserve","k":27,"code":"HLV"},{"chapter":"1","text":"Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves.

They did not become the light of the world but shut themselves away in order to escape temptation.
