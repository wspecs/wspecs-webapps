Thus our literature work was in many places the opening wedge to prepare the way for the establishment of local churches and mission stations.] I was shown men and women studying with intense interest papers and a few pages of tracts upon present truth. They would read the evidences so wonderful and new to them, and would open their Bibles with a deep and new interest, as subjects of truth that had been dark to them were made plain, especially the light in regard to the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. As they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so, a new light shone upon their understanding, for angels were hovering over them, and impressing their minds with the truths contained in the publications they had been reading.","ref":"396.1","k":1452,"code":"PM"},{"chapter":"40","text":"I saw them holding papers or tracts in one hand, and the Bible in the other, while their cheeks were wet with tears; and bowing before God in earnest, humble prayer, to be guided into all truth—the very thing He was doing for them before they called upon Him.

Important work is before us, and if we are slothful servants we shall certainly lose the heavenly reward. But few have broad and extensive views of what can be done in reaching the people by personal, interested efforts in a wise distribution of our publications. Many who will not be induced to listen to the truth presented by the living preacher will take up a tract or a paper and peruse it; many things they read meet their ideas exactly, and they become interested to read all it contains. Impressions are thus made upon their minds which they cannot readily forget. The seed of truth has in some cases been buried for years beneath the rubbish of the world, and the pleasing fables that deceived ones have enjoyed. After a time some earthly sorrow or affliction softens their hearts, and the seed springs up and bears fruit to the glory of God.","ref":"397.2","k":1455,"code":"PM"},{"chapter":"40","text":"Again, many read these papers and tracts and their combativeness is aroused, and they throw the silent messengers from them in a passion.

Again the hand takes up the neglected paper or tract, and the eye is tracing the truthful lines, and again in passion it is thrown from them as their path is crossed. But the mind is not at rest; the abused paper is at last perused, and thus point after point of truth commences its convicting work; step by step the reformation is wrought, self dies, and the warfare and antagonism to the truth is ended. The despised paper or tract is henceforth honored as the means of converting the stubborn heart and subduing the perverse will, bringing it in subjection to Christ. Had the living preacher spoken as pointedly, these persons would have turned from him, and would not have entertained the new and strange ideas brought before them. The papers and tracts can go where the living preacher cannot go, and where if he could go he would have no access to the people, because of their prejudice against the truth.","ref":"397.3","k":1456,"code":"PM"},{"chapter":"40","text":"I have been shown that but few have any correct idea of what the distribution of papers and tracts is doing.
